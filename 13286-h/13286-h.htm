<h2><a name="Page_8"></a><i>INTRODUCTION</i></h2>

<br>
<p>The word "fat" is one of the most interesting in food chemistry.
It is the great energy producer. John C. Olsen, A.M., Ph.D., in his
book, "Pure Food," states that fats furnish half the total energy
obtained by human beings from their food. The three <i>primary</i>,
solid cooking fats today are:</p>

<center><img title="" alt="Butter Lard Crisco" src=
"images/blcrisco.jpg" width="939" height="291"></center>

<p>There are numbers of substitutes for these, such as butterine,
oleomargarine and "lard compounds."</p>

<p>The following pages contain a story of unusual interest to
<i>you</i>. For you <i>eat</i>.</p>

<a name="The_Story_of_Crisco"></a>

<h2><a name="Page_9"></a><i>The Story of Crisco</i></h2>

<p>The culinary world is revising its entire cook book on account
of the advent of Crisco, a new and altogether different cooking
fat.</p>

<p>Many wonder that any product could gain the favor of cooking
experts so quickly. A few months after the first package was
marketed, practically every grocer of the better class in the
United States was supplying women with the new product.</p>

<p>This was largely because four classes of
people&mdash;housewives&mdash;chefs&mdash;doctors&mdash;dietitians&mdash;were
glad to be shown a product which at once would make for more
<i>digestible</i> foods, more <i>economical</i> foods, and better
<i>tasting</i> foods.</p>

<br>


<h3>Cooking and History</h3>

<img title="" alt="Cooking and History" src="images/img01.jpg"
style="float: right" width="152" height="153">

<p>Cooking methods have undergone a marked change during the past
few years. The nation's food is becoming more and more wholesome as
a result of different discoveries, new sources of supply, and the
intelligent weighing of values. Domestic Science is better
understood and more appreciated.</p>

<img title="" alt="Cooking and History" src="images/img02.jpg"
style="float: left" width="200" height="243">

<p>People of the present century are fairer to their stomachs,
realizing that their health largely depends upon this faithful and
long-suffering servant. Digestion and disposition sound much the
same, but a good disposition often is wrecked by a poor
digestion.</p>

<p>America has been termed a country of dyspeptics. It is being
changed to a land of healthy eaters, consequently happier
individuals. Every agent responsible for this national digestive
improvement must be gratefully recognized.</p>

<img title="" alt="Cooking and History" src="images/img03.jpg"
style="float: left" width="164" height="204">

<p>It seems strange to many that there can be anything
<i>better</i> than butter for cooking, or of greater utility than
lard, and the advent of Crisco has been a shock to the older
generation, born in an age less progressive than our own, and prone
to contend that the old fashioned things are good enough.</p>

<p>But these good folk, when convinced, are the greatest
enthusiasts. Grandmother was glad to give up the fatiguing spinning
wheel. So the modern woman is glad to stop cooking with expensive
butter, animal lard and their inadequate substitutes.</p>

<img title="" alt="Cooking and History" src="images/img04.jpg"
style="float: right" width="218" height="144">

<p>And so, the nation's cook book has been hauled out and is being
revised. Upon thousands of pages, the words "lard" and "butter"
have been crossed out and the word "Crisco" written in their
place.</p>

<br>


<h3>A Need Anticipated</h3>

<p>Great foresight was shown in the making of Crisco.</p>

<p>The quality, as well as the quantity, of lard was diminishing
steadily in the face of a growing population. Prices were rising.
"The high-cost-of-living" was an oft-repeated phrase. Also, our
country was outgrowing its supply of butter. What was needed,
therefore, was not a <i>substitute</i>, but something <i>better</i>
than these fats, some product which not only would accomplish as
much in cookery, but <i>a great deal more</i>.</p>

<p>When, therefore, Crisco was perfected, and it was shown that
here finally was an altogether <i>new</i> and <i>better</i> fat,
cookery experts were quick to show their appreciation.</p>

<p>In reading the following pages, think of Crisco as a
<i>primary</i> cooking fat or shortening with even more
individuality (because it does greater things), than all
others.</p>

<br>


<h3>Man's Most Important Food, Fat</h3>

<p>No other food supplies our bodies with the <i>drive</i>, the
vigor, which fat gives. No other food has been given so little
study in proportion to its importance.</p>

<p><a name="Page_11"></a>Here are interesting facts, yet few
housewives are acquainted with them:</p>

<p>Fat contains more than twice the amount of energy-yielding power
or calorific value of proteids or carbohydrates. One half our
physical energy is from the fat we eat in different forms. The
excellent book, "Food and Cookery for the Sick and Convalescent,"
by Fannie Merritt Farmer, states, "In the diet of children at
least, a deficiency of fat cannot be replaced by an excess of
carbohydrates; and that fat seems to play some part in the
formation of young tissues which cannot be undertaken by <i>any
other constituent of food</i>...."</p>

<p>The book entitled "The Chemistry of Cooking and Cleaning," by
the two authorities, Ellen H. Richards and S. Maria Elliott, states
that the diet of school children should be regulated carefully with
the fat supply in view. Girls, especially, show at times a dislike
for fat. It therefore is necessary that the fat which supplies
their growing bodies with energy should be in the purest and most
inviting form and should be one that their digestions
<i>welcome</i>, rather than repel.</p>

<img title="" alt="Crisco" src="images/img05.jpg" style=
"float: right" width="345" height="180">

<p>The first step in the digestion of fat is its melting. Crisco
melts at a lower degree of heat than body temperature. Because of
its low melting point, thus allowing the digestive juices to mix
with it, and because of its vegetable origin and its purity, Crisco
is the easiest of all cooking fats to digest.</p>

<p>When a fat smokes in frying, it "breaks down," that is, its
chemical composition is changed; part of its altered composition
becomes a non-digestible and irritating substance. The best fat for
digestion is one which does <i>not</i> decompose or break down at
frying temperature. Crisco does not break down until a degree of
heat is reached <i>above</i> the frying point. In other words,
Crisco does not break down at all in normal frying, because it is
not necessary to have it "smoking hot" for frying. No part of it,
therefore, has been transformed in cooking into an irritant. That
is one reason why the stomach welcomes Crisco and carries forward
its digestion with ease.</p>

<br>


<h3>Working Towards an Ideal</h3>

<img title="" alt="Years of Study" src="images/img06.jpg" style=
"float: right" width="174" height="186">

<p>A part of the preliminary work done in connection with the
development of Crisco, described in these pages, consisted of the
study of the older cooking fats. The objectionable <a name=
"Page_12"></a>features of each were considered. The good was
weighed against the bad. The strength and weakness of each was
determined. Thus was found what the ideal fat should possess, and
what it should <i>not</i> possess. It must have every good quality
and no bad one.</p>

<p>After years of study, a process was discovered which made
possible the ideal fat.</p>

<p>The process involved the changing of the composition of
vegetable food oils and the making of the richest fat or solid
<i>cream</i>.</p>

<p>The Crisco Process at the first stage of its development gave,
at least, the basis of the ideal fat; namely, a purely
<i>vegetable</i> product, differing from all others in that
absolutely no animal fat had to be added to the vegetable oil to
produce the proper stiffness. This was but one of the many
distinctive advantages sought and found.</p>

<br>


<h3>Not Marketed Until Perfect</h3>

<p>It also solved the problem of eliminating certain objectionable
features of fats in general, such as rancidity, color, odor,
smoking properties when heated. These weaknesses, therefore, were
not a part of this new fat, which it would seem was the parent of
the Ideal.</p>

<p>Then after four years of severe tests, after each weakness was
replaced with strength the Government was given this fat to analyze
and classify. The report was that it answered to none of the tests
for fats already existing.</p>

<br>


<h3>A Primary Fat</h3>

<p>It was neither a butter, a "compound" nor a "substitute," but
<i>an entirely new product</i>. A <i>primary</i> fat.</p>

<p>In 1911 it was named Crisco and placed upon the market.</p>

<p>Today you buy this rich, wholesome cream of nutritious food oils
in sanitary tins. The "Crisco Process" alone can produce this
creamy white fat. No one else can manufacture Crisco, because no
one else holds the secret of Crisco <a name="Page_13"></a>and
because they would have no legal right to make it. Crisco is
Crisco, and nothing else.</p>

<br>


<h3>Finally Economical</h3>

<img title="" alt="Finally Economical" src="images/img07.jpg"
style="float: left" width="336" height="258">

<p>At first, it looked very much as if Crisco must be a high-priced
product. It cost its discoverers many thousands of dollars before
ever a package reached the consumer's kitchen.</p>

<p>Crisco was not offered for sale as a <i>substitute</i>, or for
housewives to buy only to save money. The chief point emphasized
was, that Crisco was a richer, more wholesome food fat for cooking.
Naturally, therefore, it was good news to all when Crisco was found
also to be more economical.</p>

<p>Crisco is more economical than lard in another way. It makes
richer pastry than lard, and one-fifth less can be used.
Furthermore it can be used over and over again in frying all manner
of foods, and because foods absorb so little, Crisco is in reality
more economical even than lard of <i>mediocre</i> quality. The
<i>price</i> of Crisco is lower than the average price of the best
pail lard throughout the year.</p>

<br>


<h3><a name="Page_14"></a>Crisco's Manufacture</h3>

<center><img title="" alt="Crisco" src="images/img08.jpg" width=
"722" height="314"></center>

<img title="" alt="Cooling, Filling, Labeling" src=
"images/img09.jpg" style="float: left" width="123" height="470">

<p>It would be difficult to imagine surroundings more appetizing
than those in which Crisco is manufactured. It is made in a
building devoted exclusively to the manufacture of this one
product. In sparkling bright rooms, cleanly uniformed employees
make and pack Crisco.</p>

<p>The air for this building is drawn in through an apparatus which
washes and purifies it, removing the possibility of any dust
entering.</p>

<p>The floors are of a special tile composition; the walls are of
white glazed tile, which are washed regularly. White enamel covers
metal surfaces where nickel plating cannot be used. Sterilized
machines handle the oil and the finished product. No hand touches
Crisco until in your own kitchen the sanitary can is opened,
disclosing the smooth richness, the creamlike, appetizing
consistency of the product.</p>

<br>


<h3>The Banishment of That "Lardy" Taste in Foods</h3>

<p>It was the earnest aim of the makers of Crisco to produce a
strictly <i>vegetable</i> product without adding a hard, and
consequently indigestible animal fat. There is today a pronounced
partiality from a health standpoint to a vegetable fat, and <a
name="Page_15"></a>the lardy, greasy taste of food resulting from
the use of animal fat never has been in such disfavor as during the
past few years.</p>

<p>So Crisco is absolutely <i>all</i> vegetable. No stearine,
animal or vegetable, is added. It possesses no taste nor odor save
the delightful and characteristic aroma which identifies Crisco,
and is suggestive of its purity.</p>

<br>


<h3>Explanation of "Hidden" Food Flavors.</h3>

<img title="" alt="True Taste of Food" src="images/img10.jpg"
style="float: left" width="209" height="168">

<p>When the dainty shadings of taste are over-shadowed by a "lardy"
flavor, the <i>true</i> taste of the food itself is lost. We miss
the "hidden" or <i>natural</i> taste of the food. Crisco has a
peculiar power of bringing out the very best in food flavors. Even
the simplest foods are allowed a delicacy of flavor.</p>

<img title="" alt="Ginger bread" src="images/img11.jpg" style=
"float: right" width="137" height="71">

<p>Take ginger bread for example: The real <i>ginger</i> taste is
there. The <i>molasses</i> and spice flavors are brought out.</p>

<p>Or just plain, every-day fried potatoes; many never knew what
the real <i>potato</i> taste was before eating potatoes fried in
Crisco.</p>

<p>Fried chicken has a newness of taste not known before.</p>

<p>New users of Crisco should try these simple foods first and
later take up the preparation of more elaborate dishes.</p>

<br>


<h3>Butter, Ever Popular</h3>

<p>It is hard to imagine anything taking the place of butter upon
the dining table. For seasoning in cooking, the use of butter ever
will be largely a matter of taste. Some people have a partiality
for the "butter flavor," which after all is largely the salt mixed
with the fat. Close your eyes and eat some fresh unsalted butter;
note that it is practically tasteless.</p>

<p><a name="Page_16"></a><img title="" alt="Butter, Ever Popular"
src="images/img12.jpg" style="float: left" width="211" height=
"123"></p>

<p>Crisco contains richer food elements than butter. As Crisco is
richer, containing no moisture, one-fifth or one-fourth less can be
used in each recipe.</p>

<p>Crisco always is uniform because it is a manufactured fat where
quality and purity can be controlled. It works perfectly into any
dough, making the crust or loaf even textured. It keeps sweet and
pure indefinitely in the ordinary room temperature.</p>

<br>


<h3>Keep Your Parlor and Your Kitchen Strangers</h3>

<p>Kitchen odors are out of place in the parlor. When frying with
Crisco, as before explained, it is not necessary to heat the fat to
<i>smoking</i> temperature, ideal frying is accomplished without
bringing Crisco to its smoking point. On the other hand, it is
necessary to heat lard "smoking <img title="" alt=
"The Lard Kitchen and The Crisco Kitchen" src="images/img13.jpg"
style="float: right" width="305" height="220"> hot" before it is of
the proper frying temperature. Remember also that, when lard smokes
and fills the house with its strong odor, certain constituents have
been changed chemically to those which irritate the sensitive
membranes of the alimentary canal.</p>

<p>Crisco does not smoke until it reaches 455 degrees, a heat
higher than is necessary for frying. You need not wait for Crisco
to smoke. Consequently the house will not fill with smoke, nor will
there be black, burnt specks in fried foods, as often there are
when you use lard for frying.</p>

<p>Crisco gives up its heat very quickly to the food submerged in
it and a tender, brown crust almost <i>instantly</i> forms,
allowing the inside of the potatoes, croquettes, doughnuts, etc.,
to become <i>baked</i>, rather than soaked.</p>

<center><img title="" alt=
"Fry this, Then this, Then this&mdash;in the same Crisco." src=
"images/img14.jpg" width="528" height="121"></center>

<p>The same Crisco can be used for frying fish, onions, potatoes,
or any other food. Crisco does not take up food flavors or odors.
After frying each food, merely strain out the food particles.</p>

<br>


<h3><a name="Page_17"></a>We All Eat Raw Fats</h3>

<p>The shortening fat in pastry or baked foods, is merely
distributed throughout the dough. No chemical change occurs during
the baking process. So when you eat pie or hot biscuit, in which
animal lard is <img title="" alt="We All Eat Raw Fats" src=
"images/img15.jpg" style="float: left" width="143" height="165">
used, <i>you eat raw animal lard</i>. The shortening used in all
baked foods therefore, should be just as pure and wholesome as if
you were eating it like butter upon bread. Because Crisco digests
with such ease, and because it is a pure vegetable fat, all those
who realize the above fact regarding pastry making are now won over
to Crisco.</p>

<p>A hint as to Crisco's purity is shown by this simple test: Break
open a hot biscuit in which Crisco has been used. You will note a
sweet fragrance, which is most inviting.</p>

<img title="" alt="No Distress" src="images/img16.jpg" style=

<p>A few months ago if you had told dyspeptic men and women that
they could eat pie at the evening meal and that distress would not
follow, probably they would have doubted you. Hundreds of instances
of Crisco's healthfulness have been given by people, who, at one
time have been denied such foods as pastry, cake and fried foods,
but who <i>now</i> eat these rich, yet digestible Crisco
dishes.</p>

<p>You, or any other normally healthy individual, whose digestion
does not relish greasy foods, can eat rich pie crust. The richness
is there, but not the unpleasant after effects. Crisco digests
<i>readily</i>.</p>

<p>As more attention is given to <i>present</i> feeding, less
attention need be given to <i>future</i> doctoring. <a name=
"Page_18"></a>Equip your children with good stomachs by giving them
wholesome Crisco foods&mdash;foods which digest with ease.</p>

<p>They may eat the rich things they enjoy and find them just as
digestible as many apparently simple foods, if Crisco be used
properly.</p>

<p>They may eat Crisco doughnuts or pie without being chased by
nightmares. Sweet dreams follow the Crisco supper.</p>

<br>


<h3>The Great Variety of Crisco Foods</h3>

<p>There are thousands of Crisco dishes. It is impossible to know
the exact number, because Crisco is used for practically every
cooking purpose. Women daily tell us of new uses they have found
for Crisco.</p>

<p>Many women <i>begin</i> by using Crisco in simple ways, for
frying, for baking, in place of lard. Soon, however, they learn
that Crisco <i>also</i> takes the place of butter. "Butter richness
without butter expense," say the thousands of Crisco users.</p>

<p>Tasty scalloped dishes, salad dressing, rich pastry, fine
grained cake, sauces and hundreds of other dishes, where butter
formerly was used, now are prepared with Crisco.</p>

<p>Kitchen expense comes by the <i>spoonful</i>. Think of the
countless spoonfuls of expensive butter used daily, where
economical Crisco would accomplish the same results at one-third
the cost.</p>

<p>It should be remembered that one-fifth less Crisco than butter
may be used, because Crisco is <i>richer</i> than butter. The
moisture, salt and curd which butter contains to the extent of
about 20 per cent are not found in Crisco, which is <i>all</i>,
(100 per cent) shortening.</p>

<p>Remember also that Crisco will average <i>a lower price per
pound throughout the year than the best pail lard</i>. And you can
use less Crisco than lard, which is a further saving. <a name=

<h3>Brief, Interesting Facts</h3>

<center><img title="" alt=
"Hotel kitchens and domestic scientists use Crisco" src=
"images/img20.jpg" width="599" height="166"></center>

<p>Crisco is being used in an increasing number of the better class
hotels, clubs, restaurants, dining cars, ocean liners.</p>

<p>Crisco has been demonstrated and explained upon the Chautauqua
platform by Domestic Science experts, these lectures being a part
of the regular course.</p>

<img title="" alt="Hospital Dietetic Class" src="images/img21.jpg"
style="float: right" width="206" height="165">

<p>Domestic Science teachers recommend Crisco to their pupils and
use it in their classes and lecture demonstrations. Many High
Schools having Domestic Science departments use Crisco.</p>

<p>Crisco has taken the place of butter and lard in a number of
hospitals, where purity and digestibility are of <i>vital</i>
importance.</p>

<p>Crisco is Kosher. Rabbi Margolies of New York, said that the
Hebrew Race had been waiting 4,000 years for Crisco. It conforms to
the strict Dietary Laws of the Jews. It is what is known in the
Hebrew language as a "parava," or neutral fat. Crisco can be used
with both "milchig" and "fleichig" (milk and flesh) foods. Special
Kosher packages, bearing the seals of Rabbi Margolies of New York,
and Rabbi Lifsitz of Cincinnati, are sold the Jewish trade. But all
Crisco is Kosher and all of the same purity.</p>

<center><img title="" alt="The Kosher Seal" src="images/img22.jpg"
width="508" height="204"></center>

<img title="" alt="Campers find Crisco helpful" src=
"images/img23.jpg" style="float: right" width="245" height="237">

<p>Campers find Crisco helpful in many ways. Hot climates have
little effect upon its wholesomeness.</p>

<p><a name="Page_20"></a>It is convenient; a handy package to pack
and does not melt so quickly in transit. One can of Crisco can be
used to fry fish, eggs, potatoes and to make hot biscuit, merely by
straining out the food particles after each frying and pouring the
Crisco back into the can to harden to proper consistency before the
biscuit making.</p>

<p>Practically every grocer who has a good trade in Crisco, uses it
in his own home.</p>

<img title="" alt="Empty Tins for Canning" src="images/img24.jpg"
style="float: left" width="300" height="150">

<p>Crisco is sold by net weight. You pay <i>only</i> for the
Crisco&mdash;not the can. Find the net weight of what you have been
using.</p>

<p>Bread and cake keep fresh and moist much longer when Crisco is
used.</p>

<p>Women have written that they use empty Crisco tins for canning
vegetables and fruits, and as receptacles for kitchen and pantry
use.</p>

<br>


<h3>Crisco's Manufacture Scientifically Explained</h3>

<p>To understand something of the Crisco Process, it is necessary
first to know that there are three main constituents in all the
best edible oils.</p>

<p>Linoline, Oleine, Stearine.</p>

<p>The chemical difference between these three components is solely
in the percentage of hydrogen contained, and it is possible by the
addition of hydrogen, to transform one component into another.</p>

<p>Though seemingly so much alike, there is a marked difference in
the physical properties of these components.</p>

<p>Linoline which has the lowest percentage of hydrogen, is
unstable and tends to turn rancid.</p>

<p>Oleine is stable, has no tendency to turn rancid and is easily
digested.</p>

<p>Stearine is both hard and indigestible.</p>

<p>The Crisco process adds enough hydrogen to change almost all the
linoline into nourishing digestible oleine.</p>

<p><a name="Page_21"></a>Mark well the difference in manufacture
between Crisco and lard compounds. In producing a lard compound, to
the linoline, oleine and stearine of the original oil is added more
stearine (usually animal), the hard indigestible fat, in order to
bring up the hardness of the oil. The resultant compound is
indigestible and very liable to become rancid.</p>

<h2><b><a name="Page_22"></a><i>Things to Remember in Connection
with These Recipes</i></b></h2>

<br>
<img title="" alt="Use level measurements" src="images/img26.jpg"
style="float: right" width="159" height="148">

<p>No need for Crisco to occupy valuable space in the refrigerator.
In fact, except in most unusual summer heat, it will be of a better
consistency outside the refrigerator. Crisco keeps sweet
indefinitely, summer and winter, at ordinary room temperature.</p>

<p>In making sauces, thoroughly blend the flour and Crisco before
adding the milk.</p>

<img title="" alt="Crisco's Purity not affected by Weather" src=
"images/img27.jpg" style="float: left" width="212" height="256">

<p>In using melted Crisco in boiled dressing, croquettes, rolls,
fritters, etc., be sure that the melted Crisco is cooled
sufficiently so that the hot fat will not injure the texture of the
foods.</p>

<p>When using in place of butter, add salt in the proportion of one
level teaspoonful to one cup of Crisco.</p>

<p>Remember that Crisco, like butter, is susceptible to cold. It
readily becomes hard. In creaming Crisco in winter use the same
care as when creaming butter. Rinse pan in boiling water and have
the Crisco of the proper creaming stiffness before using. Unlike
butter, however, Crisco's purity is not affected by weather. It
remains sweet and pure indefinitely without refrigeration.</p>

<p>In deep frying, do not wait for Crisco to smoke. (See page <a
href="#Page_35">35</a>.)</p>

<hr style="WIDTH: 65%">
<a name="Remember_Thatmdash"></a>

<h2><b><a name="Page_23"></a><i>Remember That</i>&mdash;</b></h2>

<br>
<p><i>When pie crust is tough:</i> It is possible you have not used
Crisco properly. Perhaps the measurements were not correct. Perhaps
the water was too warm, or the dough was handled too much.
Shortening cannot make pastry tough.</p>

<p><i>When fried foods absorb:</i> It is because Crisco is not hot
enough, or because you have not used enough Crisco. Use plenty and
the raw foods, if added in small quantities, will not reduce the
heat of the fat. The absorption in deep Crisco frying should be
less than that of another fat.</p>

<p><i>When cake is not a success:</i> It is not the fault of the
Crisco. Either too much was used, the oven heat not perfectly
controlled or some important ingredient was used in the wrong
proportion. Crisco should be creamed with the sugar more thoroughly
than butter, as Crisco contains no moisture to dissolve the
sugar.</p>

<p><i>When cake or other food is not flavory:</i> Salt should have
been added to the Crisco, for Crisco contains no salt.</p>

<p><i>When there is smoke in the kitchen:</i> Crisco has been
burned or heated too high for frying. Or some may have been on the
<i>outside</i> of the pan or kettle.</p>

<p><i>When Crisco is too hard:</i> Like butter, it is susceptible
to heat and cold. Simply put in a warmer place.</p>

<br>
<p>Before commencing to cook, look up the required recipe, read and
think it out. Note down on a slip of paper the materials and
quantities required. Collect all utensils and materials required
before commencing. Success in cookery depends on careful attention
to every detail from start to finish. Quantities, both liquid and
dry, should be exact. Small scales and weights should form part of
the kitchen equipment where possible, and the measuring cups cost
so little that no one need be without them.</p>

<a name="How_to_Choose_Foods"></a>

<h2><a name="Page_25"></a><i><b>How to Choose Foods</b></i></h2>

<p>Money can be spent to infinitely better advantage in the store,
than by giving orders at the door, by phone or mail. Every
housekeeper knows how large a proportion of the housekeeping money
is swallowed up by the butcher's bill, so that with the meat item
careful selection is most necessary in order to keep the bills
within bounds.</p>

<p>In choosing meat of any kind the eye, the nose and the touch
really are required, although it is not appetizing to see the
purchaser use more than the eye.</p>

<br>


<h3>Beef</h3>

<p>In choosing meat it should be remembered that without being
actually unwholesome, it varies greatly in quality, and often an
inferior joint is to be preferred from a first class beast to a
more popular cut from a second class animal. To be perfect the
animal should be five or six years old, the flesh of a close even
grain, bright red in color and well mixed with creamy white fat,
the suet being firm and a clear white. Heifer meat is smaller in
the bone and lighter in color than ox beef. Cow beef is much the
same to look at as ox beef, though being older it is both coarser
in the grain and tougher; bull beef, which is never seen however,
in a first class butcher's may be recognized by the coarseness and
dark color of the flesh, and also by a strong and almost rank
smell.</p>

<br>


<h3>Mutton</h3>

<p>To be in perfection, mutton should be at least four, or better
five or six years old, but sheep of this age are rarely if ever,
met with now-a-days, when they are constantly killed under two
years. To know the age of mutton, examine the breast bones; if
these are all of a white gristly color the animal was four years
old or over, while the younger it is the pinkier are the bones,
which, in a sheep of under a year, are entirely red.</p>

<p>Good mutton should be of a clear dark red, the fat firm and
white, and not too much of it; when touched the meat should feel
crisp yet tender. If the fat is yellow and the lean flabby and
damp, it is bad. A freshly scraped wooden skewer run into the meat
along the bone will speedily enable anyone to detect staleness. For
roasting mutton scarcely can be hung too long, <a name=
"Page_26"></a>as long as it is not tainted; but for boiling it must
not be kept nearly so long or the meat will be of a bad color when
cooked.</p>

<br>


<h3>Lamb</h3>

<p>The freshness of lamb is comparatively easy to distinguish, as
if fresh the neck vein will be a bright blue, the knuckles stiff,
and the eyes bright and full.</p>

<br>


<h3>Veal</h3>

<p>Veal is at its best when the calf is from three to four months
old. The meat should be of a close firm grain, white in color and
the fat inclining to a pinkish tinge. Veal is sometimes coarser in
the grain, and redder in the flesh, not necessarily a mark of
inferiority, but denoting the fact that calf has been brought up in
the open. Like all young meat, veal turns very quickly, therefore
it never should hang more than two or three days. In choosing veal
always examine the suet under the kidney; if this be clammy and
soft, with a faint odor, the meat is not good, and always reject
any that has greenish or yellowish spots about it. The head should
be clean skinned and firm, the eyes full and clear, the kidneys
large and well covered with fat, the liver a rich dark clear color,
free from any spots or gristle, while the sweetbreads should be
firm, plump, of a delicate color, and free from strings.</p>

<br>


<h3>Pork</h3>

<p>The flesh of pork, when in good condition, is a delicate pinky
white, with a close fine grain; the fat, which should not be too
abundant, of a white color, very faintly tinged with pink; the skin
should be thin and elastic to the touch, and the flesh generally
cool, clean, and smooth looking; if, on the contrary, the flesh is
flabby and clammy when touched, it is not fresh.</p>

<p>Pork, like all white meat, is quick to taint, and never should
be kept long before cooking. If you have the slightest doubt about
pork, it is best to reject it, for unlike other meat which may be
quite wholesome and usable, though not of precisely prime quality,
pork <i>must</i> be in really first class condition to be
wholesome, and therefore it is impossible to be too particular in
the choice of it. Always if possible look at the tongue, for, as in
beef, this is a very fair criterion of the condition of the animal;
a freshly scraped new wooden skewer run into the meat along the
bone is a good test of the freshness of the pork, and be careful
especially to examine the fat, for if there be little kernels in it
the pork is "measly," <a name="Page_27"></a>a very common disease
among pigs, and one particularly unwholesome to the consumer.</p>

<p>Pigs for fresh pork should be of medium size, not over fat, and
under a year old. Pigs destined to become bacon are usually older
and larger. Sucking pigs should be small, and are best when about
three weeks old. A sucking pig should be cooked as soon as possible
after it is killed, as it taints very quickly; unless fresh, no
care in the cooking will make the crackling crisp, as it should
be.</p>

<br>


<h3>Ham&mdash;Bacon</h3>

<p>Good bacon has the lean of a bright pink and fine in the grain,
while the fat is white and firm. If the lean is high colored, it
probably has been over salted and is old besides, and in
consequence will be hard and salty; while if there be yellow marks
in the fat, and a curious, rather musty smell, it will have an
unpleasant taste. In choosing a ham always run a clean knife or
skewer in at the knuckle, and also at the center; if it comes out
clean and smelling sweet, the ham is good; but if out of order the
blade of the knife will be smeared and greasy looking, and have a
disagreeable, strong odor.</p>

<br>


<h3>Venison</h3>

<p>The condition of venison is judged chiefly by the fat, which
should be a clear creamy white color, and close in texture. Always
try venison by running a sharp knife along the haunch bone, which
is usually the first to turn; if, in taking it out, the knife has a
blackish-green look and an unpleasant odor, the meat is tainted,
and unfit for use. Venison requires to be kept a considerable time
before it is in proper condition, and needs great care in its
management. It must be examined carefully every day, and if there
is the slightest doubt, it should be washed in lukewarm milk and
water, then dried in clean cloths, and when perfectly dry, should
be covered thickly all over with ground ginger and pepper; when
required for use, dust off the pepper and ginger, and wash the meat
in a little lukewarm water, and dry it thoroughly. Venison, like
mutton, improves with age, and this can be judged by the condition
of the hoof, which in a young animal has a small, smooth cleft,
while in an old one it is deeply cut and rugged. The haunch is the
prime joint, its perfection depending on the greater or less depth
of the fat on it. The neck and shoulder also are very good. They
are used chiefly for stews or pies.</p>

<br>
<a name="Page_28"></a>

<h3>Hares and Rabbits</h3>

<p>A hare when fresh killed is stiff and red; when stale, the body
is supple and the flesh in many parts black. If the hare be old the
ears will be tough and dry, and will not tear readily. Rabbits may
be judged in the same manner. In both, the claws should be smooth
and sharp. In a young hare the cleft in the lip is narrow, and the
claws are cracked readily if turned sideways.</p>

<br>


<h3>Poultry</h3>

<p>Poultry to be perfect, should have just reached their full
growth (the only exceptions to this are "spring chickens,"
ducklings, goslings, etc., which are considered delicacies at
certain seasons); they should be plump, firm fleshed, and not over
fatted. Over-fed fowls are often a mass of greasy fat, which melts
in the cooking and spoils the flavor of the bird. A hen is at her
best just before she begins to lay; her legs should be smooth, her
comb small, bright, and soft. A young cock has the comb full,
bright colored, and smooth, the legs smooth, the spurs short, and
in both the toes should break easily when turned back, and the
weight of the birds should be great in proportion to their size.
Contrary to the practice with game, poultry never should be kept
long, as they turn easily, and are spoilt if the least high. They
also require longer cooking, in proportion to their size, than
game, and never should be underdone. Dark-legged fowls are best for
roasting, as their flesh is moister and better flavored cooked in
this way than the white-legged ones, which from their greater
daintiness of appearance are to be preferred for boiling.</p>

<p><i>Turkeys</i> should be plump, white-fleshed, young, the legs
plump and firm, black and smooth, with (in the cock) short spurs,
the feet soft and supple; the eyes should be full and clear, the
neck long, and the wattles of a bright color. A hen turkey is best
for boiling. Like fowls, an old turkey is fit for nothing but the
stewpan or the stockpot. Turkeys require hanging for at least a
week, though they must never be "high" or "gamey."</p>

<p><i>Geese</i> always should be chosen young, plump, and full
breasted, a white skin, a yellow smooth bill, the feet yellow and
pliable. If the feet and bill are red and hard, and the skin hairy
and coarse, the bird is old. Geese should be hung for a few days.
Ducks, like geese, should have yellow, supple feet; the breasts
full and hard, and the skin clear. Wild ducks should be fat, the
feet small, reddish, and pliable, the breast firm and heavy. If not
fresh, there will be a disagreeable smell <a name=
"Page_29"></a>when the bill is open. The male is generally the more
expensive, though the female is usually more delicate in
flavor.</p>

<p><i>Pigeons</i> always should be young and extremely fresh, and
when so, they are plump and fat, with pliable smooth feet.</p>

<p>NOTE&mdash;In selecting game pluck a few feathers from the under
part of the leg; if the skin is not discolored the bird is fresh.
The age may be known by placing the thumb into the beak, and
holding the bird up with the jaw apart; if it breaks it is young;
if not, it is old, and requires longer keeping before cooking to be
eatable.</p>

<p><i>Guinea-fowl</i> are judged like poultry, but require hanging
for some time.</p>

<br>


<h3>Fish</h3>

<p>Fish in good condition usually is firm and elastic to the touch,
eyes bright and prominent, gills fresh and rosy. If the fish is
flabby, with sunken eyes, it either is stale or out of
condition.</p>

<p><i>Salmon</i> should have a small head and tail, full thick
shoulders, clean silvery scales, and its flesh of a rich yellowish
pink. When quite fresh there is a creamy curd between the flakes,
which are stiff and hard; but if kept this melts, softening the
flesh and rendering it richer, but at the same time less
digestible.</p>

<p><i>Trout</i>, in spite of the difference in size, may be judged
by the same rule as salmon. However, it will not bear keeping,
deteriorating rapidly.</p>

<p><i>Cod</i>, unlike salmon, should have a large head and thick
shoulders; the flesh being white and clear, and separating easily
into large flakes, the skin clean and silvery. Most people consider
cod improves by being kept for a day or two and very slightly
salted.</p>

<p><i>Herrings</i> must be absolutely fresh to be good, and when in
this state their scales shine like silver. If kept over long their
eyes become suffused with blood.</p>

<p><i>Mackerel</i> also must be quite fresh. They never should be
bought if either out of condition or season. If fresh they are
peculiarly beautiful fish, their backs of an iridescent blue green
barred with black, and their bellies of a pearly whiteness.</p>

<p><i>Smelts</i> should be stiff and silvery, with a delicate
perfume faintly suggestive of cucumber.</p>

<p><a name="Page_30"></a><i>Halibut</i> is a wholesome fish. It
should be middling size, thick and of a white color.</p>

<p><i>Lobsters, Crabs, Prawns, and Shrimps</i> are stiff, and with
the tails tightly pressed against the body. With the former, weight
is a great guide, as the heavier they are the better; but if there
be the least sign of wateriness, they should be rejected at
once.</p>

<br>


<h3>Vegetables</h3>

<p>Green vegetables always are at their best when cheapest and most
plentiful. Out of season they never have the same flavor, however
well they may be grown. Excepting artichokes, all summer
vegetables, as lettuce, peas, beans, and asparagus should be cooked
as soon as possible after gathering. The freshness of most
vegetables may be ascertained easily by taking a leaf or a pod
between the fingers. If fresh this will snap off short and crisp,
while if stale it will be limp and soft. It is an economy to buy
winter vegetables, such as carrots, parsnips, turnips, beets,
celery, and potatoes in large quantities, if you have storage room,
as if buried in sand and kept from the frost they may be kept a
considerable time. Onions should be kept hung up in a cool, dry
place. If allowed to sprout the flavor becomes rank and coarse.</p>

<br>


<h3>Eggs</h3>

<p>A mode of ascertaining the freshness of eggs is to hold them
before a lighted candle or to the light, and if the egg looks
clear, it will be tolerably good; if thick, it is stale; and if
there is a black spot attached to the shell, it is worthless. No
egg should be used for culinary purposes with the slightest taint
in it, as it will render perfectly useless those with which it has
been mixed. Eggs may be preserved, however, for a considerable time
without any further special precaution than that of keeping them in
a cool place. A very effective method of preserving eggs for winter
use is to rub a little melted Crisco over each to close the pores,
and then to pack the eggs in bran, salt or sawdust, not allowing
them to touch each other.</p>

<h2><a name="Page_31"></a><i>Methods of Cooking</i></h2>

<br>
<p>There are seven chief methods of cooking meat&mdash;roasting,
boiling, baking, stewing, frying, broiling and poaching.</p>

<p>The first three are most suitable for joints weighing four
pounds or more, but not satisfactory for smaller pieces which are
liable to become hard and flavorless by the drying up or loss of
their juices.</p>

<p>Of the other three methods, stewing may be applied to fairly
large and solid pieces, but it is better for smaller thin ones,
while frying and broiling can be used only for steaks, chops, and
similar cuts.</p>

<p>Braising and steaming are combinations and modifications of
these methods.</p>

<br>


<h3>Roasting</h3>

<p>Roasting is one of the oldest methods of cooking on record, and
still remains the favorite form of cooking joints of meat or birds.
The success of every method of cooking depends largely upon the
correct management of the fire. In roasting, this is particularly
the case, as a clear, brisk and yet steady fire is needed. To roast
a joint it should be placed before great heat for the first ten
minutes and then allowed to cook more slowly. The great heat
hardens the outside of the meat and keeps in the juices. If allowed
to cook quickly all the time the meat is likely to be tough. The
fire should be bright and clear. The joint should be basted about
every ten minutes, as this helps to cook it, keeps it juicy and
improves the flavor. The time allowed is fifteen minutes for every
pound, twenty minutes over for beef and mutton; for veal and pork
twenty minutes for every pound and thirty minutes over.</p>

<br>


<h3>Oven Roasting</h3>

<p>Roasting in the oven of ordinary coal stoves or ranges is not
considered so good as roasting before an open fire; nevertheless it
may be said safely that the greatest part of <a name=
"Page_32"></a>meat roasting is done in close ovens. It appears,
from various experiments that meat roasted or baked in a close oven
loses rather less of its weight than if roasted by an open
fire.</p>

<p>The excellence of a roast depends to a great extent upon the
amount of basting it receives.</p>

<p>Some cooks season a joint before it is cooked, while others
season it with salt and pepper just before it is served. There is a
difference of opinion as to which is the more correct way of the
two. Meat of newly killed animals requires longer cooking than meat
which has been hung for a time.</p>

<p>In warm weather joints require slightly less time for roasting
than in cold.</p>

<p>Boned and rolled or stuffed meats require longer cooking than
the same joints would if neither rolled nor stuffed. The meat of
young animals and that of old ones requires different treatment. As
a rule young flesh, containing less fibrine, requires longer
cooking. White meat, such as pork, veal and lamb, always should be
well cooked and never must be served rare. The exact time and
process of roasting must be left to the good management of the
cook, who must be guided by circumstances and conditions. The
cook's business is to serve the joint as full of nourishing
qualities as possible. Though roasting is considered one of the
easiest and most simple processes of cookery, it really requires
quite as much attention to obtain perfect results as is necessary
to prepare so-called "made" dishes, the recognized test for good
cooks.</p>

<br>


<h3>Boiling</h3>

<p>Boiling (of fresh meat).&mdash;This is cookery by immersion in
boiling liquid, which after a few minutes is reduced to simmering.
The object of the high temperature at first is to harden the
surface albumen and so seal the pores and prevent the escape of the
juices. If continued too long, this degree of heat would tend to
toughen the joint throughout; after the first few minutes,
therefore, the heat must be reduced to about 180&deg; F. The pan
used for boiling meat should be only just large enough to hold the
joint, and the quantity of liquid no more than is required to cover
it. For the boiling of salt meat the general rule of first
hardening the surface is not to be followed. The salting of meat
withdraws a large proportion of its juices, while at the same time
the salt hardens the fibres, and this hardness would be intensified
by extreme heat. Very salt meat sometimes is soaked in cold water
to <a name="Page_33"></a>extract some of the salt, but whether this
is done or not, the rule for boiling salt meat is to immerse it in
cold or tepid water and bring slowly to boiling point; boil for
five minutes to seal the pores and prevent any further loss of
juice, then reduce to 180&deg; F., and maintain a uniform
temperature till the meat is cooked. Salt meat takes longer to cook
than fresh meat, and the saltness may be qualified by boiling
vegetables with the meat, turnips especially being useful for this
purpose.</p>

<br>


<h3>Baking</h3>

<p>The actual differences between roasting and baking are not
great, the terms being frequently interchanged. Meat loses rather
less weight when baked than when roasted, but the flavor of meat is
inferior and less developed. The heat of an oven being steadier,
baking takes somewhat less time than roasting. In a gas oven having
an open floor the current of air is not impeded, and such baking
very nearly approaches roasting, and the flavor generally is
acknowledged to be the same.</p>

<br>


<h3>Stewing</h3>

<p>Stewing is cooking slowly with a small quantity of liquid in a
covered vessel. The method is specially suitable for the coarser
and cheaper parts of meat, which are rendered tender without loss
of their juices. The usual plan is to make a gravy flavored and
colored to suit the stew, and after the ingredients are well
blended and cooked to lay the meat in the boiling liquid. After
about two minutes boiling, the temperature is reduced to simmering,
about 160&deg; F., a lower temperature than that required for a
large joint of "boiled" meat. The time depends greatly on the
quality of the meat, but none will stew satisfactorily in less than
from one and a half to two hours, and the longer allowance is to be
preferred.</p>

<br>


<h3>Broiling</h3>

<p>Broiling, sometimes called grilling, is cooking by the direct
action of fire brought almost into contact with the meat. The outer
surface is burned or seared, the albumen hardened and the juices,
which have a tendency to escape on the side turned from the heat,
are retained in the meat by frequent turning. The fire for broiling
must be very clear, intensely hot and high in the grate. The
utensil required for broiling is a gridiron, the bars of which are
greased and heated to <a name="Page_34"></a>prevent sticking and
subsequent tearing of the meat. The gridiron is laid quite close
over the heat, so that the lower surface is dried and hardened at
once.</p>

<p>The meat must be turned at very short intervals before the
juices have been driven from the heat to the opposite surface. If
once allowed to reach the surface, they will be thrown off in
turning and lost, the meat being correspondingly impoverished. By
constant turning the juices are kept moving backwards and forwards,
and the meat remains moist and full of flavor. Each side should be
exposed to the fire about three times, and it is not desirable to
use meat less than one inch or more than one and a half to two
inches thick for the purpose.</p>

<p>The thinner pieces should have even greater heat applied than
the thick ones, as the longer thin ones are exposed to the fire the
more dry and tasteless they become, while the thicker pieces may be
slightly withdrawn after thoroughly hardening the surface and
cooked rather more slowly that the heat may penetrate to the
center. The frequent turning must be continued, or the juices will
reach the hardened outer fibres, soften them, and escape.</p>

<p>If a double broiler is used the turning is managed easily, but
with a single gridiron care must be taken not to puncture the meat
by using a fork. Steak tongs are made for the purpose of lifting
and turning broiled meat, but a spoon or a spoon and knife will
answer. A single rim of fat on the chop or steak will tend to keep
the edge moist and baste the meat, but too much will cause flame to
rise in continuous jet, making the surface smoky. If there is
absolutely no fat on the piece to be broiled, morsels of finely
chopped suet may be occasionally thrown into the fire, so the
sudden spurt of flame from this source leaves a deposit of fat on
the meat which improves the flavor, and, without softening the
albumen, prevents its becoming uneatably hard and dry.</p>

<br>


<h3>Frying</h3>

<p>Frying may be looked on as a derivative of broiling, and passes
by easy stages, from broiling on a slightly greased metal plate, or
<i>saut&eacute;ing</i> in a shallow pan in a small quantity of
Crisco, to cooking by actual immersion into a bath of hot fat. In a
house where small and delicately made dishes are in demand, and
where variety in the re-dressing of cold meats has <a name=
"Page_35"></a>to be studied, this frying in deep fat is one of the
cook's most needed accomplishments. Though exceedingly easy to do
well, it is also exceedingly easy to do badly.</p>

<p>Deep fat frying, which means submerging the food in the fat, is
far superior to shallow or saute frying, and can be done most
economically with Crisco. Little is absorbed by the foods, and the
Crisco does not take up the odor or flavor of the food which is
fried in it. This characteristic makes it possible to use Crisco
for frying one article of food after another.</p>

<p>Use <i>plenty</i> of Crisco for frying. The temperature of the
hot Crisco then will be but little lowered when the food is added.
There is little absorption and what is left may be used for
<i>all</i> frying, merely by straining out food particles after
each frying.</p>

<p>Sufficient Crisco should be put into the pan to fill it about
two-thirds full. From two to three pounds for a pan eight inches in
diameter will not be too much. Into this pan or kettle a wire
"frying-basket" should fit quite loosely, the basket measuring
quite an inch less across the top than the pan.</p>

<p>Let Crisco get hot gradually in the pan. Do not put into an
already hot container. No fat should be treated in this manner.</p>

<br>
<a name="Do_Not_Wait_for_Crisco_to_Smoke"></a>

<h3>Do Not Wait for Crisco to Smoke</h3>

<br>
<p>Heat Crisco until a crumb of bread becomes a golden brown in</p>

<p>60 seconds for raw dough mixtures, as crullers, fritters,
etc.</p>

<p>40 seconds for cooked mixtures, as croquettes, codfish balls,
etc.</p>

<p>20 seconds for French fried potatoes.</p>

<p>Seconds may be counted thus: one hundred and one, one hundred
and two, etc.</p>

<p>The fat may be tested also by dropping into it a little piece of
the article to be cooked. When it rises to the top, bubbles
vigorously and browns quickly, the fat is hot enough.</p>

<p>When prepared, the foods must be placed in the basket, not too
many at a time or too close together, and then lowered <a name=
"Page_36"></a>gently into the fat. They generally will sink to the
bottom for a minute or two, and only float when they have begun to
brown. When a bright golden brown, take up the basket and let the
fried things drain in it, over the hot fat, for a few seconds. Then
take them out gently one by one, and lay them on a sheet of brown
or kitchen paper.</p>

<p>The draining over the pan is one of the principal things to
attend to; if this be neglected, the fat will cling about the fried
things, making them both look and taste greasy, whereas if properly
drained in the basket to begin with, they will afterwards scarcely
mark the paper. When, as is sometimes the case, no frying basket is
used, each thing fried should be drained between a spoon and the
edge of the pan.</p>

<br>


<h3>To Clarify</h3>

<p>It is economy to use three pounds in the kettle, clarifying the
fat when it is put away. To clarify Crisco, take that which has
been used for deep frying and when it has cooled, but not
solidified, strain through a double thickness of cheese cloth,
replace kettle on stove, drop several slices of potato into the
Crisco and reheat. <img title="" alt="To Clarify" src=
"images/img30.jpg" style="float: right" width="210" height="118">
When the potatoes are golden brown, take out and pour the Crisco
back into the tin. With this little care, fish, oysters, onions,
chops, fritters, doughnuts, etc., may be fried over and over again
in the same Crisco.</p>

<p>The dry or saute method of frying is less satisfactory, in that
it is difficult even after much practice to produce a uniformly
colored surface. A small quantity of fat only is needed, and where
the fat, i.e., the heat, ends, a crack is formed in the outer coat,
through which flavor escapes and fat enters; the appearance also is
rendered unsightly. Flat fish can be fried fairly well by this
method, or, indeed, almost any thin substance, as thin edges are
not affected in this way. For pancakes and other articles of
similar nature it is the best method. It rarely is possible to use
the fat from the dry method a second time, except for dishes of the
same kind, as the fat always is more or less flavored by the food
cooked in it. The most digestible fat for frying and the best for
results undoubtedly is Crisco.</p>

<br>
<p><a name="Page_37"></a></p>

<h3>Steaming</h3>

<p>Steaming is a process very similar to boiling, for it is cooking
in the heated vapor of water. This practice as a means of cookery
is largely adopted in hotels, clubs, schools and hospitals, and
other large institutions; also frequently applied in ordinary home
cookery for particular articles of food requiring a very slow
process of cooking. An ordinary kitchen steamer, with a
close-fitting lid is generally all that is required for simple
household cookery on a small scale. The articles of food which are
to be steamed are prepared in exactly the same manner as for
boiling. Many puddings, some meats, and some vegetables are
considered better if cooked by steam, and inasmuch as the process
of cooking is a very slow one, there is no fear of the food being
destroyed by too fierce a heat, as the temperature in steaming
never reaches beyond 212&deg; F. Fish, meat and poultry cooked by
steam are as a rule tender, full of gravy and digestible. By
steaming, watery vegetables are made drier; tough meats are
softened and made tender; while farinaceous mixtures and puddings
develop a totally different flavor when baked or fried.</p>

<br>


<h3>Braising</h3>

<p>Braising is a combination of roasting and stewing small joints
of meat in a shallow stewpan. It is a favorite method of cooking
with the French, and is supposed to bring out an unusually fine
flavor and aroma. The pan in which a braise is to be made always
should be lined with slices of bacon, carrot, onions and herbs,
upon which the meat is placed. It usually is moistened with stock
or stock and wine. The more delicate meats, such as sweetbreads,
fillets, fowls and turkeys sometimes are covered with buttered
paper; this is done to prevent the heat from the top of the pan
scorching or imparting too much of a roast flavor to the meats
which are to be braised. Occasional basting during the process of
this method of cooking is essential. When done, the meat is taken
up, the fat removed from the vegetables and gravy, which latter is
then reduced, strained and blended with some kind of gravy or thin
sauce.</p>

<br>


<h3>Poaching and Marinating</h3>

<p>Poaching is the name usually given to the process of cooking an
article by placing it for a few minutes in boiling water.
Marinating or pickling is a process with a formidable <a name=
"Page_38"></a>name with a simple meaning. To marinate simply is to
soak meat in a mixture for some hours, or even days, with the idea
of improving its flavor of softening its fibres and making it
tender. Vinegar, oil, pepper and salt are mixed together and the
meat packed in the mixture; sometimes a sliced onion and herbs are
added. The meat, of course, should be wiped first, but not
washed.</p>

<br>


<h3>Cooking in Earthenware</h3>

<p>Stone or earthenware cooking appliances are used to very great
advantage for various forms of preparing food. For the homely
<i>pot-au-feu</i> the French housewife has used fireproof
earthenware dishes for generations, and does so today. But besides
soups, various savory dishes, and all sorts of stews are cooked in
stoneware pots. Indeed, so much has this form of cookery come into
fashion that many dishes are sent to table in the pots in which
they are cooked. Cooking in stoneware has no equal where slow
cooking is aimed at, and there are many dishes which one would do
well to refrain from attempting unless cooked in this fashion.
These cooking pots are inexpensive, and certain foods taste
decidedly better if cooked in this way. For braising, pot roasting,
or stewing fruit and other articles which need to be cooked slowly
under close cover, the application of a moderate, even heat
produces far better results than if quick heat is applied. For such
cases the use of earthenware cooking pots is recommended.</p>

<a name="The_Art_of_Carving"></a>

<h2><b><a name="Page_42"></a><i>The Art of Carving</i></b></h2>

<br>
<p>Carving is an art, and one which anybody, with a knowledge of a
few general directions, can acquire easily.</p>

<p>A proper set of carving tools is almost indispensable, and
should comprise: a good thin, sharp-bladed knife, a solid two or
three pronged fork, and a pair of carving scissors. Anything that
needs to be carved at table should be placed on a dish sufficiently
large to allow the joint to be turned without moving the dish from
its position. The dish should be placed close in front of the
carver. Such joints as beef, veal and ham should be cut very thin;
while lamb, mutton, and pork should be cut a trifle thicker.</p>

<p><i>To carve a fowl</i>, begin by sticking the fork into the
pinion and draw it towards the leg; and then, passing the knife
underneath, take off the wing at the joint. Next slip the knife
between leg and body, to cut through the joint; and with the fork
turn leg back, and joint will give way. Then take off other wing
and leg. After legs are taken off, enter knife into the top of
breast, and cut under merrythought or wishbone so as to loosen it,
lifting it with the fork. Afterwards cut slices from both sides of
breast. Next, take off collarbones, which lie on each side of
wishbone and then separate side bones from the back. The breast and
wings are considered the most delicate parts; the back as the least
desirable, generally is left on platter.</p>

<p><i>A turkey</i> is carved in same manner, except that the legs
and wings, being larger, are separated at lower joint. Lower part
of leg (or drumstick) being hard, tough, and stringy, usually is
allowed to remain on platter. First cut off wing, leg, and breast
from one side; then turn turkey round and cut them off from the
other.</p>

<p><i>To carve a goose</i>, separate leg from body by putting fork
into small end of leg, pressing it close to body, and then passing
knife under, and turning leg back as you cut through joint. To take
off wing, put fork into the small end of wing, and press it closely
to body, then slip knife under and separate the joint. Next, cut
under wishbone and take it off, <a name="Page_43"></a>and cut
slices from breast. Then turn and dismember the other side. Take
off upper side bones next to wings, then two lower side bones. The
breast and legs of a goose are considered the most choice. If a
goose is old, there is no fowl so tough.</p>

<p><i>Quails</i> merely are split down the back, as also are
pigeons, giving a half to each person.</p>

<p><i>To carve loin of mutton,</i> a portion is cut through,
beginning at the best end. If kidney be in it, a slice should be
served as far as it will go to each portion. Care must be taken
that the bone is well jointed. The butcher chops the loin between
each vertebra. When big mutton is carved it gives a large chop,
oftentimes more than the amount desired, but a chop cannot be
divided without waste, or one portion being all the inferior end.
It is therefore a good plan to joint a loin of mutton with a small
meat saw, cutting any thickness desired. In this case the actual
bone will often have to be sawn through. The result will be more
economical, and the servings more agreeable. The loin also can be
boned entirely, stuffed or not, as preferred, the flap end folded
and fastened over the fillet portion. Then the meat can be carved
across any thickness.</p>

<p><i>To carve leg of mutton,</i> stand joint the inner part of the
leg uppermost and cut across center to bone, towards carver, then
cut rather thick slices on either side. To serve the meat equally,
unless any special part is desired, a portion of the knuckle is
served with a slice of the thick end. The prime fat is the kernel
of fat at the thick end.</p>

<p><i>To carve forequarter of mutton or lamb.</i> The forequarter
of mutton usually is not served whole unless the mutton be very
small. The forequarter of lamb frequently is served whole. Before
cooking it must be jointed through the chine of bone at the back,
to enable this portion being served in chops, twice across the
breastbones the entire length, and at short intervals at the edge
of the breast. Before serving it is usual to separate the shoulder
by pressing the fork in by the knuckle, then passing knife round
shoulder, crossing about center of joint, raising shoulder without
cutting too much meat off breast. Leave shoulder in position on
joint; a second dish is sent to table on which to lay it while the
other part is being carved.</p>

<p><i>To carve rabbit or hare.</i> In either case first separate
legs and shoulders; then cut the back part across, into two parts.
<a name="Page_44"></a>This is accomplished best by inserting the
knife into joint, and raising up the back by means of the fork. The
back or fillet part is considered the best portion of a hare or
rabbit.</p>

<p><i>To carve sirloin of beef,</i> a sirloin should be cut into
thin slices with a sharp, firm cut from end to end of the joint. At
the upper portion the cut should be clean and even; then use point
of knife to loosen slices from bones. In carving undercut, remove
superfluous fat, and cut slices from end to end in same manner as
upper portion. Be careful always to cut down straight to the bone
of a sirloin or rib of beef; by so doing you will not spoil
appearance of joint, and what remains will look tidy.</p>

<p><i>To carve ham.</i> Ham should be cut through to the bone first
from center or near thin end. Slices must be cut thin. Always
commence cutting from upper side. The fairest way by far, so as to
serve fat and lean evenly, is to begin cutting from center of
thickest part, and to cut thin circular slices; by this means the
flavor of the ham is far better, and it will prove to be the more
economical way of serving.</p>

<p><i>To carve ox-tongue.</i> Commence cutting from middle of
tongue; cut slices not too thin and take them from each side being
careful not to cut slices through to bottom part of tongue. Extreme
end of the tip and the lower part of tongue generally are used up
for chopping in salpicons, etc. A little of the fat should be put
on each plate. When rolled tongue is served it must be cut
horizontally into rather thin slices.</p>

<p><i>To carve fish.</i> A silver sheer or trowel should be used
for this purpose; a steel knife applied to fish often spoils the
delicacy of its flavor. Great care must be taken to prevent
breaking the flakes, which ought to be kept as entire as possible.
Short-grained fish, such as salmon, etc., should be cut lengthwise,
not crosswise.</p>

<a name="SOUPS"></a>

<div id="soups">
<p>An economical housewife may supply good gravy and thick soups at
very little, if any, addition to the weekly expenses, as soups are
an excellent method of using up scraps and bones from joints and
vegetables that otherwise are wasted. Soup, if taken as the primary
course of a substantial dinner, if well flavored and warm, acts as
a stimulant in the stomach, exciting the gastric glands, and
generally enabling that organ to perform its functions more easily.
For this object the soup should be thin and not too much of it
partaken, otherwise it dilutes the digestive juices too much. If it
is to form the chief part of the meal, the soup will be more
nutritious if thickened, especially so, if pulse&mdash;i.e. peas,
beans, and lentils&mdash;is used as the thickening medium.</p>

<p>Stock is the liquid in which meat, bones, or vegetables have
been cooked, and which contains an extract from these substances.
It is used for soups, sauces, and gravies. Fresh or cooked bones or
meat may be used. A stock pot may be kept on the stove, into which
are put any scraps of meat, bones, gristle, or vegetable; at the
end of the day it is strained, and all fat taken off. Bones and
meat for stock must be broken into small pieces. Cold water should
be used, and a little salt to extract the nutriment. The whole must
be brought slowly to the boiling point; then, the temperature
lowered, the fat and scum taken off. When wanted for clear soups
the vegetables should be cleaned, but not cut up, or with the long
cooking they may mash and thicken the soup. In hot weather it is
better to leave out the vegetables, as the stock turns sour more
quickly if vegetables have been used in its preparation. They can
be cooked separately and added when using the stock.</p>

<p>The soup should simmer for five or six hours to extract the
gelatinous matters. If the stock is skimmed occasionally it will be
much clearer. Keep the lid on the stock pot to prevent <a name=
"Page_47"></a>loss by evaporation. The bones can be cooked again
next day for a second stock, but the vegetables must be taken out.
Care must be taken that nothing doubtful in freshness be put into
the stock pot. Meat and bones should be well wiped with a damp
cloth before using them. If onions be put in the soup unpeeled,
simply washed and the root end cut off, they will help to color the
soup. When using eggs for other dishes, if the shells be washed
before breaking them and added to the stock pot they will help to
clear the soup. For clear soups care must be taken that nothing of
a floury nature be added to the stock pot. Stock always should be
strained before cooling. Never allow it to stand in stock pot all
night. Clear gravy soup consists of the extractives, flavoring
matters, and gelatine of meat and bones.</p>

<p>Consomm&eacute; is a good stock made from beef, veal, and often
fowl, and flavored with vegetables, cooled, freed from fat. It is
clarified with whites and shells of eggs, and chopped raw lean
beef, and strained through a cloth. It should be brilliantly clear
and of a pale brown color. Any fat floating on the stock may be
removed by passing a piece of kitchen or blotting paper over the
surface. Soup left from a meal will keep better if strained from
the vegetables that have been served in it. In hot weather, stock
left over must be boiled each day, and poured into a clean basin to
prevent its turning sour. In warm weather, soups with milk in their
composition should have a pinch of baking soda added.</p>

<p>Thickenings for soup consist usually of yolks of eggs and cream
beaten together in a basin, the boiling soup poured on slowly,
stirring well at the same time. Soups thus thickened should not be
allowed to boil again, otherwise they will curdle. Instead of eggs
and cream, cornstarch and milk may be used to thicken the soup.</p>

Draw it to the side of fire and let cool slightly. Beat yolks of
eggs with cream, and, when soup has cooled, strain them in. Reheat
soup without boiling it, to cook eggs. Season, and add few drops
lemon juice and chopped parsley. Serve with small pieces of dry
toast.</p>

<h3>Lentil Soup</h3>

<center>
<table cellpadding="10" summary="recipe">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>1 cupful lentils<br>
 2 cupfuls milk<br>
 3 tablespoonfuls Crisco<br>
 3 pints stock or water<br>
 1 onion<br>
 1 carrot<br>
 </td>
<td>2 stalks celery<br>
 1 tablespoonful flour<br>
 1 bay leaf<br>
 Salt and pepper to taste<br>
 1/4 cupful cream<br>
 Croutons<br>
 </td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</center>

<p>Wash lentils; soak twenty-four hours; drain well. Cut onion,
carrot and celery into small pieces, then put them into a saucepan
with Crisco, cover, and cook gently for fifteen minutes. Add stock
and simmer 2 hours, then rub through sieve. Return to pan, add
milk, seasonings, and bring to boil. Moisten flour with 1/2 cupful
milk or stock, add it to soup and simmer five minutes. Season to
taste and add cream. Serve with croutons of fried or toasted
bread.</p>

<p>Lentils are a small leguminous seed, not so generally known as
beans, but an excellent nitrogenous food, containing about 25 per
cent. protein, more than 50 per cent. starch, with over 2 per cent.
fat. They are not used as much as they ought to be.</p>

<p>Croutons are made by cutting bread into tiny cubes and browning
through and through in hot oven or putting into a frying pan with 2
tablespoonfuls Crisco and browning well. If latter is used great
care must be used as the croutons will brown easily.</p>

remains of lobster in mortar or basin, and pound quite smooth with
Crisco. Soak bread in water, adding flour, and seasonings, and put
all on fire in soup pot with pounded lobster and Crisco; stir till
it boils, and boil for fifteen minutes; then pass it through sieve,
add milk and pieces of lobster, and return to the pot till it boils
up. Serve with small squares of fried bread, and send thin slices
of lemon to table with it. This is an excellent soup, and can of
course be made with fresh lobster.</p>

<h3>Norfolk Puree</h3>

 4 tablespoonfuls cooked peas<br>
 Salt, pepper, and paprika to taste<br>
 Diced toast or fried bread<br>
 </td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</center>

<p>Put barley into saucepan of cold water, bring to boil, let boil
five minutes, then drain off water; this removes the slightly
bitter taste. Now put barley into saucepan with Crisco and water,
let these boil gently until <a name="Page_50"></a>barley is tender,
drain, and rub through sieve. Add stock to this puree and let
simmer ten minutes. Beat yolk of egg with cream and when soup has
cooled slightly, strain them in. Stir soup over fire a few minutes
to reheat; but be careful that it does not boil, or it will curdle.
Season carefully, add carrot balls and peas, which should first be
heated in a little stock or water. Serve with dice of toast or
fried bread. If you do not possess a round vegetable cutter, cut
the carrot into small dice. This is a particularly nourishing soup.
If you prefer a slightly cheaper variety, use milk instead of
cream, and if you have no white stock use milk and water in equal
proportions instead, and cook a carrot, turnip and onion in milk
and water for twenty or thirty minutes.</p>

<a name="FISH"></a><a name="Page_51"></a><br>
<div id="fish">
<p>Fish, though not quite so nutritious or so stimulating as
butcher's meat, is an excellent article of diet, as it is light and
easy of digestion and well suited to delicate persons and those
following sedentary occupations, who generally do not take exercise
in the fresh air. Fish contains a fair proportion of flesh forming
and mineral matter, and the white kinds very little fat, hence
their value in a sick diet. A few fishes are rich in fat, as
salmon, mackerel, eels, and herrings; they are more satisfying as a
meal, but usually more difficult to digest, except the latter,
which is fairly easy to digest, and, being inexpensive, forms an
economical food.</p>

<p>The digestibility will vary also with the quality of the fish
and the methods of cooking. White fish when boiled is improved by
being rubbed over with a cut lemon, or by adding a little vinegar
to the water in which it is cooked to keep it white and firm. The
fish should be put into hot, not boiling water, otherwise the
higher temperature contracts the skin too quickly, and it breaks
and looks unsightly. Salt fish may be placed in cold water, then
boiled to extract some of the salt; if the fish has been salted and
dried, it is better to soak it in cold water for about twelve hours
before cooking.</p>

<p>Fish to be fried should be cooked in sufficient hot Crisco to
well cover it, after having been dried and covered with batter, or
with beaten egg and breadcrumbs. To egg and breadcrumb fish put a
slice into seasoned flour, turning it so that both sides may be
covered. Shake off all loose flour. Brush fish over with beaten
egg. Raise fish out of egg with the brush and a knife, drain off
egg for a second, and lay fish in crumbs. Toss these all over it,
lift out fish, shake off all loose crumbs, lay the slice on a
board, and press crumbs down, so that surface is flat. The thicker
the fish the more slowly it must be fried after the first two
minutes, or it will be raw inside when the outside is done.</p>

<p><a name="Page_52"></a><i>To bone fish.</i> The process of boning
is known as filleting and is generally done by the fish dealer, but
when this is not the case the single rule for boning must be
strictly adhered to in order to keep the knife on the bone lifting
the flesh with the left hand while the knife slips in between the
bone and the flesh. Flat fish are divided down the middle of each
side well into the bone, and the boning is begun at either side of
the incision. Round fish are cut down the back, the flesh is laid
open from one side and the bone is removed from the other.
Occasionally round fish are boned readily, the whole fish minus the
bones being returned to its proper shape, as in anchovies,
sardines, herrings, haddocks, etc., in this case the fish would be
split down the front, not the back, and stitched together after
boning.</p>

<p>Fish stock is made from the bones, skin and trimmings of white
fish. These are broken small and generally flavored with onion,
parsley, herbs, and seasonings. The proportion of water used is
rather larger, as the flavor is much stronger and also more easily
extracted than from meat.</p>

<a name="MEATS"></a><a name="Page_58"></a>

<div id="meats">
<p>Cookery is a branch of applied chemistry. To cook anything, in
the narrower sense of the term, means to bring about changes in it
by submitting it to the action of heat, and usually of moisture
also, which will make it more fitted for food; and it is on the
nature of this action on different materials that the
<i>rationale</i> of the cook's art chiefly depends. Good cooking
can make any meat tender, and bad cooking can make any meat
tough.</p>

<p>The substance in meat called albumen becomes tougher and more
indigestible, the higher the temperature to which it is subjected
reaches beyond a certain point. It is this effect of heat on
albumen, therefore, which has to be considered whenever the cooking
of meat is in question, and which mainly determines the right and
the wrong, whether in the making of a soup or a custard, the
roasting or boiling of a chicken or a joint, or the frying of a
cutlet or an omelet.</p>

<p>We now will see to begin with, what are the special ways in
which it bears on meat cookery. Take a little bit of raw meat and
put it in cold water. The juice gradually soaks out of it, coloring
the water pink and leaving the meat nearly white. Now take another
bit, and pour boiling water upon it; and though no juice can be
seen escaping, the whole surface of the meat turns a whitish color
directly.</p>

<p>Lean meat is made up of bundles of hollow fibres within which
the albuminous juices are stored. Wherever these fibres are cut
through, the juice oozes out and spreads itself over the surface of
the meat. If, as in our first little experiment, the meat is put in
cold water, or even in warm water, or exposed to a heat
insufficient to set the albumen, either in an oven or before the
fire, the albuminous juices are in the first case drawn out and
dissolved, and in the second evaporated. In either case the meat is
deprived of them. But if the <a name="Page_59"></a>meat is put into
boiling water or into a quick oven or before a hot fire, the
surface albumen is quickly set, forms a tough white coating which
effectually plugs the ends of the cut fibres, and prevents any
further escape of their contents.</p>

<p>Here, then, we have the first principles on which meat cookery
must be conducted; viz: that if we wish to get the juices out of
the meat, as for soups and stews, the liquid in which we put it
must be cold to begin with; while if we wish, as for boiled or
roast meat, to keep them in, the meat must be subjected first of
all to the action of boiling water, a hot fire or a quick oven. The
meats of soups and stews must not be raw, and that of joints must
not be tough; and the cooking of both one and the other, however it
is begun, should be completed at just such a moderate temperature
as will set, but not harden, the albumen. That is to say, the soup
or stew must be raised to this temperature, after the meat juices
have been drawn out by a lower one, while a joint or fowl must be
lowered to it after the surface albumen has been hardened by a
higher one.</p>

<p>All poultry or game for roasting should be dredged with flour
before and after trussing, to dry it perfectly, as otherwise it
does not crisp and brown so well. Unless poultry is to be boiled or
stewed it never should be washed or wet in any way as this renders
the flesh sodden and the skin soft. Good wiping with clean cloths
should be quite sufficient. With the exception of ducks and geese,
all poultry and game require rather a large addition of fat during
roasting, as the flesh is dry. Chickens will cook in from twenty to
thirty minutes; fowls take from thirty to sixty minutes when young
and tender, the only condition in which they are fit to roast;
turkeys take from one to two hours and even more if exceptionally
large. Game takes longer in proportion to its size than poultry,
and all birds require better and more cooking than beef or
mutton.</p>

<p>Sweetbreads should always be blanched before using. To blanch,
soak in cold water two hours, changing water 3 or 4 times. Put into
saucepan, cover with cold water, add little salt, and skim well as
water comes to boil. Simmer from ten to thirty minutes, according
to kind of sweet-bread used. Remove to basin of cold water until
cold, or wash well in <a name="Page_63"></a>cold water and press
between two plates till cold. Dry, remove skin, cut in slices, coat
with beaten egg and toss in breadcrumbs, and fry in hot Crisco to a
golden brown. Serve round peas or new potatoes, with rich brown
gravy.</p>

<p>For those whose digestions are at fault, sweetbreads ought to be
eaten as a daily ration if the pocketbook will afford it. For this
special part of the animal's anatomy is that one of all the viscera
whose mission is to help digestion. It is of the very pancreas
itself, that stomach gland of marvelously involved structure which
elaborates the powerful pancreatic juice. It is alkaline in nature,
able to digest starches, fats, and most of what escapes digestion
in the stomach proper. It received its name from a fancied
resemblance in its substance and formation to the rising lumps of
dough destined for bread.</p>

<hr style="WIDTH: 65%">
<a name="VEGETABLES"></a><a name="Page_66"></a><br>
<div id="veggies">
<p>In the vegetable kingdom the cereals form a very important part
of our diet, by supplying chiefly the carbohydrates or heat giving
matter. Another nutritious group termed pulse, are those which have
their seed enclosed in a pod. The most familiar are peas, beans,
and lentils; peas and beans are eaten in the green or unripe state
as well as in the dried. Vegetables included in the pulse group are
very nourishing if they can be digested, they contain a large
amount of flesh forming matter, usually a fair amount of starch,
but are deficient in fat. Peas and beans also contain sulphur and
tend to produce flatulence when indulged in by those of weak
digestion. Lentils contain less sulphur, and do not produce this
complaint so readily.</p>

<p>The more succulent vegetables include tubers, as potatoes and
Jerusalem artichokes, leaves, stems, and bulbs, as cabbages,
spinach, celery, and onions, roots and flowers, as carrots,
parsnips, and cauliflower. These are very valuable on account of
the mineral matter, chief of which are the potash salts, so
necessary to keep the blood in a healthy condition.</p>

<p>Care should be taken in cooking vegetables not to lose the
salts. Steaming is preferable to boiling, by preserving the juices,
though it does not tend to improve the color of green vegetables. A
little lemon juice added to the water in which new potatoes are
boiling improves their color. Mint is sometimes cooked with new
potatoes. To secure a good color in vegetables when cooked, careful
cleaning and preparation before cooking is essential. Earthy roots,
such as potatoes, turnips, and carrots, must be both well scrubbed
and thoroughly rinsed in clean water before peeling. From all
vegetables, coarse or discolored leaves and any dark or decayed
spots should be carefully removed before cooking.</p>

<p>Potatoes should be peeled thinly, or, if new, merely brushed or
rubbed with a coarse cloth to get the skin off. <a name=
"Page_67"></a>Turnips should be thickly peeled, as the rind in
these is hard and woody. Carrots and salsify, unless very old, need
scraping only. After the removal of the skin, all root vegetables
(except those of the onion kind) should be put in cold water till
wanted. Potatoes, artichokes, and salsify especially, must not
remain a moment out of water after peeling, or they will turn a
dark color, and to the water used for the two last, a little salt
and lemon juice should be added in order to keep them white.</p>

<p>Root vegetables should be boiled with the lid of the pan on,
green vegetables should be boiled with the lid of the pan off, for
the preservation of the color.</p>

<a name="SALADS"></a><a name="Page_73"></a>

<div id="salads">
<p>Salads are classified into two groups&mdash;i.e., the raw, such
as lettuce, endive, radishes, cucumber, celery, etc., and the
cooked, such as those made from cooked vegetables, eggs, cooked
cold fish, poultry, and meat. The raw materials should be washed
most carefully and well cleaned before mixing, and the utensils for
cutting and mixing, as well as the basins or bowls used, should be
clean and dry. Every salad, no matter how plain and simple it may
be, should be made to look inviting and tempting. The method of
draining or drying is a very easy performance so long as the salad
leaves, whatever they may be, are almost free from moisture. This
is effected best by putting the leaves, which should be broken, not
cut with a knife, into a wire basket and drying them well, or else
putting them into a cloth lightly folded and shaking well until the
outer moisture of the leaves is well absorbed. The salad then is
ready for mixing.</p>

<p>Any cold boiled vegetables left over from dinner are useful as
giving variety to salads, and help to make a good accompaniment to
cold meat served to luncheon. Thinly sliced cold potatoes&mdash;new
ones for choice, green peas and string beans, are especially good
for this purpose, and even Brussels sprouts, carrots, and turnips
may be used on occasion in small quantities. More substantial
salads, prepared with cold meat or fish, form appetizing luncheon
or breakfast dishes. Those made with chicken, lobster and salmon
respectively are most widely known, but fillets of flounder, cold
ham or beef, or lamb make very good salads, and even the humble
herring, and dried and salted fish, may be used with advantage in
this way.</p>

<p>The meat or fish should be cut up into cubes or convenient small
pieces, and piled up in the center of the dish or salad bowl on a
layer of seasoned, shredded lettuce. Over this should be poured
half of the dressing. Round this should be arranged the green <a
name="Page_74"></a>constituents of the salad, cut up rather small,
garnished with slices of tomato or beets, cucumber and hard-cooked
egg. The remainder of the dressing should be poured over this, and
the top of the meat or fish pyramid may be ornamented with a few
sprigs of endive or parsley.</p>

<a name="PUDDINGS"></a><br>
<div id="puddings">
<p>Puddings as a rule either are boiled, steamed or baked. For
boiled puddings, care should be taken that the saucepan be kept
boiling or the water will get into the pudding and spoil it. For
pudding cloths, use materials such as linen or cheese cloth. After
using, the cloth must be thoroughly washed in plenty of water with
a little washing soda, but on no account use soap, and see that the
cloth is perfectly dry before putting it away. Many puddings are
lighter and better steamed, and then instead of the cloth only a
piece of Criscoed paper is required, twisted over the top of the
basin or mold. Very light puddings, such as custards, should be
placed in a steamer. Most of the steamed puddings mixed a little
softer, are excellent baked in a pudding dish.</p>

<p>In steaming puddings keep them at a uniform heat all the time,
and be careful not to lift the lid off the pan for the first half
hour. All farinaceous puddings should be cooked well, as then they
are easier to digest. Cornstarch must be well cooked, from eight to
ten minutes. Mold for jellies or blanc-manges should be well rinsed
with cold water before using. Batters must be well beaten and
allowed to stand for thirty minutes or longer before cooking,
because the starch in the flour swells, and the batter will
therefore be lighter. Batter puddings should be put into a quick
oven. Puddings composed principally of milk and eggs should be very
gently cooked, as strong heat will cause them to curdle.</p>

<p>In stewing fruit, prepare syrup first. Bring to boil, lay fruit
in, and simmer gently. Souffles should be very light and spongy.
Eggs form a large part of souffles, more whites than yolks are used
and the former are beaten to a stiff froth. All souffles should be
served quickly. Omelets are composed mainly of eggs. They can be
savory or sweet. If over-cooked an omelet will be tough. To prevent
milk running <a name="Page_78"></a>over when it comes to boil, put
spoon in saucepan. Never leave spoon in saucepan if you wish the
contents to cook quickly, and in any case a metal spoon never
should be allowed to stand in a boiling saucepan containing fruit
or any acid.</p>

<p>If the slices of bread have to be spread with butter or with a
paste it should be done before they are cut off. The slices should
not be cut thicker than an eighth of an inch. When butter is used
there must just be enough of it for us to know in some mysterious
fashion that it is there. Every scrap of a sandwich should be
eatable. Sandwiches usually are served on folded napkins, and
arranged in circles, so that one overlaps the other. It is well to
lay a damp napkin over the sandwiches, if they are not wanted
immediately, in order to keep them moist. To make superior sandwich
butter, work one cupful of butter in a basin with a clean and dry
wooden spoon until soft; then add by degrees half a cupful of
whipped cream, seasoning of salt and mustard, and put it in a cool
place until required.</p>

<div id="pastries">
<p>There are two principal divisions, within which all varieties
may be included, viz:</p>

<p>1. Short or plain pastries.</p>

<p>2. Flaky pastries.</p>

<p>Of these, the former includes all pastes in which the fat is
mixed evenly with the dough throughout; the latter, those in which,
by one means or another, the two are arranged in alternate layers.
The short pastes are the simplest, and for this reason should be
experimented on to begin with. With pastry, a good deal always
depends on the mixing. The best way is to measure out the average
quantity of liquid, to pour about three-quarters of this gradually
into the flour, at the same time stirring this briskly with a
knife, so as to get it evenly moistened, and then add, in very
small quantities at a time, as much more water as may be needed. To
see, in this way, when the flour has been moistened enough, is
easy. By the time the first three parts of water have been put in,
most of it will have stuck together in little separate rolls; if on
pressing these they should not only cling together, but readily
collect about them whatever loose flour there may be, sufficient
moisture will have been added; but so long as the mixture, when
pressed, remains to some degree crumbly, it is a sign that a little
more water is required. When done, the paste should stick together,
but should not adhere either to the hands or to the basin. If it
does this it is too wet, and more flour must be dusted over it and
kneaded in till the surplus moisture has been absorbed. A sure sign
of its having been mixed properly is when it can be rolled into a
lump, and the basin wiped out cleanly with it, as with a cloth. To
roll out, flour the pastry board slightly, lay the dough on it, and
form it into a neat, flat oblong shape.</p>

<p><a name="Page_89"></a>Press it out first a little with the
roller, and then roll with short, quick strokes to the thickness
required. Always roll straight forwards, neither sideways nor
obliquely. If the paste wants widening, alter its position, not the
direction of the rolling. At the beginning of each stroke, bring
the roller rather sharply down, so as to drive out the paste in
front of it, and take especial care in rolling to stop always just
short of the edges. Short pastry differs from the flaky pastries in
requiring but one rolling out.</p>

<p>It should be handled and rolled as little as possible and when
carefully made it should not be in the least leathery or tough. Air
in this method is mixed equally throughout the paste, and when it
expands in the oven raises the paste in all directions. The
flakiness of pastry depends upon the kind and amount of shortening
used. Crisco makes tenderer crust than either lard or butter. Make
pastry in a cool atmosphere and on a cool surface. The lightness of
pastry depends largely upon the light handling in blending the
Crisco with the flour and in the rolling of the pastry upon the
board. The best results are obtained by cutting the Crisco into the
flour with a knife.</p>

<p>If pastry contains baking powder it should be put into the oven
as quickly as possible, but if it contains a liberal supply of
Crisco without baking powder, it improves by being set aside in a
cool place a few hours. Pastry that is light, dry and flaky, is
separated more easily by the gastric fluids than that which is
heavy. The flour must be of good quality, fine and dry. All pastry
requires to be placed in a hot oven, slightly hotter for flaky than
short crust. The oven should register from 310&deg; F. to 340&deg;
F. The great heat quickly will cause the starch grains to burst and
absorb the fat, otherwise the pastry will be heavy.</p>

<p>In making flaky pastry, if it has been rolled and folded
properly, and not allowed to stick to the board, nor cut so that
air can pass through layers, this air when heated in the oven
expands and raises the paste in layers or puffs. Heat of oven must
be great enough to fix the pastry in this raised condition, and as
cold air prevents this, the oven door must not be opened too soon,
or any more than necessary. See that the oven is clean.</p>

with knife. May be used at once, but will be improved if allowed to
stand in cool place for one hour. Should be rolled out once and
handled as lightly as possible. May be used for sweet or savory
dishes. Bake in hot oven. The purpose of the addition of lemon is
to render gluten of flour more ductile, so that it will stretch
rather than break as paste is rolled out, or as it rises in
oven.</p>

<p>Mix salt with flour; divide Crisco into four equal parts, rub in

water. Shape into neat oblong piece, and roll into straight strip
about three times as long as it is broad. All over this put on,
with the point of knife, one of remaining quarters of Crisco,
distributing it evenly in little dabs about size of a pea, so that
they look like buttons on a card. Now flour surface lightly and
fold paste exactly in three by taking hold of the two bottom
corners and doubling them upwards from you and then of the top
corners and doubling them downwards towards you. Turn now at right
angles to its former position so as to have open ends pointing
towards you. Press these quickly together with the roller to
inclose some air, and press paste across also in two or three
places, making little ridges, thus preventing air which has been
shut in, from forming into large bubble. Roll out again, and repeat
till remaining two parts of Crisco have thus been used. At the last
rolling, bring to required thickness; and if it needs widening as
well as lengthening, turn it at right angles to its former
position, and roll straight across it as before, a rule which, with
flaky pastry, should always be observed, since, unlike the short
pastries, its lightness suffers if rolled obliquely to the
direction in which it has been folded.</p>

<h3>Puff Pastry</h3>

<p>Measure Crisco and set in cold place to chill it. Sift flour and
salt into basin, and add lemon juice. Take a quarter of the Crisco,
and rub it lightly into flour with finger tips until there are no
lumps left. Beat yolk of egg and add a little cold water, then add
them to the flour, making them into a stiffish dough. Turn this on
to floured board, and work well with hands until it will no longer
stick to fingers and forms a perfectly smooth dough. Form into
oblong piece and roll out to about half inch thickness. The Crisco
to be used should be as nearly, as possible of same consistency as
the paste.</p>

<p>Form it into neat flat cake, and place in center of pastry. Fold
up rather loosely, and flat the folds with rolling-pin. Place in
refrigerator for ten minutes. Then roll out pastry into long narrow
strip, being careful <a name="Page_93"></a>that Crisco does not get
through. Fold exactly in three, press down folds, and lay aside in
cool place or in refrigerator fifteen minutes. This is called
giving the pastry one "turn" and seven of these is the number
required for this pastry. The next time the pastry is rolled, place
it with the joins at your right hand side, and open end's towards
you. Give two "turns" this time, and again set aside in cool place
for at least fifteen minutes. Repeat this until pastry has had
seven rolls in all. The object of the cooling between the rolls is
to keep Crisco and flour in distinct and separate layers, in which
it is the function of the rolling-pin and folding to arrange them,
and on which the lightness of the pastry depends.</p>

<p>When rolling, keep the pressure of the two hands as equal as
possible. If the pastry becomes rounded, it shows that there is
more pressure being done on the rounded side than the other. After
it has received its last roll, it is better to be laid aside before
using, then rolled to the thickness required.</p>

<div id="breads">
<p>The usual method of making bread is to ferment dough with yeast;
the latter acts upon certain constituents in the flour ultimately
producing a gas which permeates the dough. The dough is placed in a
very hot oven, the heat kills the yeast plant, the gas expands with
the heat, still raising the dough. The loaf is set in shape, and,
when finally cooked and the gas all escaped, will be found to be
light and full of tiny holes. Certain factors hasten or delay these
changes. A moist, warm medium being most favorable to the growth of
the yeast, the water should just be lukewarm; then a good flour,
containing about 8 per cent of gluten is necessary. This gluten is
the proteid in flour; when well mixed with water it forms a viscid
elastic substance, hence it is necessary to well knead dough to
make it more springy, so that when the gas is generated in it, it
will expand and take the form of a sponge, and thus prevent the gas
from escaping. The bread must be put into a very hot oven at first,
340&deg; F., so that the yeast plant is killed quickly. If this be
not accomplished soon, the loaf may go on spreading in the oven,
and, if not sour in taste, will not be of such a good flavor.</p>

<p>Plenty of salt in dough is said to strengthen the gluten, give a
good flavor to the bread, and keep it moist for a longer time, but
it rather retards the working of the yeast. Flour also may be made
into a light loaf by using baking powder to produce the gas. This
is a much quicker process, but the bread is not liked so
universally as when made with yeast. For, when yeast is used, other
changes take place in the dough besides the production of the gas,
that seem to give bread the characteristic flavor constantly
welcome by the palate. Good flour has a slight pure smell, free
from any moldy odor.</p>

<p>Yeast is a fungoid growth, a microscopic plant capable of
starting a fermentation in various substances. It grows <a name=
"Page_97"></a>rapidly in a favorable medium, as when mixed with
flour and water, and kept in a warm place, resulting in setting up
fermentation. Baking powders are composed of an acid and an alkali.
Some kind of flour usually is added to keep them dry and free from
lumps. When the mixture containing the baking powder is moistened
the acid and the alkali chemically combine and alter, a gas being
generated. If the articles be placed soon in great heat, the gas is
warmed, expands, and in its endeavor to escape raises the mass. The
heat sets the mixture in this raised condition, thus the cake or
pudding is rendered light, easier to masticate and digest.</p>

<p>Baking powders are used for two reasons. First. To supply a gas
to take the place of ingredients, as when used in making bread,
buns, etc. If flour, salt and water were mixed and baked in a large
loaf, it would be a hard, indigestible mass. If baking powder be
mixed in with similar ingredients and baked, the result would be a
light loaf, easy to masticate and digest.</p>

<p>Second. It is used to save labor. When a richer mixture be made
it requires to be well beaten to mix in air. Baking powder often is
added to save some of the otherwise necessary beating.</p>

floured board; pat and roll to one-half inch thickness. Shape with
biscuit cutter. Place on Criscoed tin and bake in hot oven twelve
minutes. To have good biscuits dough should be handled as little as
possible, just enough to get in shape to cut. Milk or water used
for mixing should be very cold, and biscuits should be gotten into
oven at once after adding liquid to flour. If top of each biscuit
is lightly brushed over with melted Crisco before baking, crust
will be much nicer. Sufficient for fifteen biscuits.</p>

<div id="cakes">
<p>There are five principal ways of making cakes.</p>

<p>The first method is used for plain cakes. The shortening is
rubbed into the flour in the same way as for short pastry; then the
dry ingredients, such as sugar, fruit, and spice, are added, and
lastly the eggs and milk. Then all are mixed well together.</p>

<p>The second way is used for fruit, pound, and seed cakes. The
shortening and sugar are creamed together, the eggs beaten in one
at a time, and the fruit and flour stirred in lightly and quickly
at the last.</p>

<p>In the third way the eggs and sugar are beaten together until
thick and creamy, then the flour is stirred in lightly and quickly.
This is used chiefly for sponge cakes and cakes of that
texture.</p>

<p>For the fourth way the sugar, shortening, milk, and syrup or
molasses are melted together, then cooled slightly and added to the
dry ingredients. This method is used for ginger-breads.</p>

<p>In the fifth way the sugar and eggs are beaten thoroughly over
boiling water, then cooled before the melted shortening and dry
ingredients are added. This method is used for Gennoise cake and
some kinds of layer cakes. Care must be taken to insure the right
consistency of cakes. The mixture should be fairly stiff. If too
moist the fruit will sink to the bottom. For rich cakes the tins
should be lined with paper, the paper coming a short distance above
the tins, so that the cake is protected as it rises. For very rich
fruit cakes, experience has shown that it is best not to grease the
paper or tin. The cake is not so liable to burn, and the paper can
be removed easily when the cake is done without injuring it. On the
other hand, if tins are lined for sponge cakes or jelly-rolls, the
paper should be greased.</p>

<p><a name="Page_116"></a>When making cakes in which baking powder,
carbonate of soda, cream of tartar or tartaric acid are used,
almost everything depends upon the handling, which should be as
light and as little as possible. The more rapidly such cakes are
made the better they will be. Two cooks working from the same
recipe will often produce entirely different results, if one kneads
her mixture as if it were household bread, while the other handles
it with due lightness of touch. As soon as the baking powder or
other rising medium is added to the mixture, the cake should be put
into the oven as quickly as possible. Soda alone is never good in a
cake where there is shortening, unless some substance containing
acid is used along with it. Molasses is one of the substances
containing acid.</p>

<p>The greatest care and cleanliness must be exercised in all cake
making; and accuracy in proportioning the materials to be used is
indispensable. The flour should be thoroughly dried and sifted, and
lightly stirred in. Always sift flour before measuring, then sift
it again with the baking powder to insure a thorough blending.</p>

<p>Good cakes never can be made with indifferent materials. Eggs
are used both as an aerating agent and as one of the "wetting"
materials. It is not economy to buy cheap eggs, for such eggs are
small, weak, colorless, and often very stale. Eggs should be well
beaten, yolks and whites separately, unless other directions are
given. The yolks must be beaten to a thick cream and the whites
until they are a solid froth. Sugar tends to improve the texture of
cakes, and when cheap cakes are made, plenty should be used,
provided that the cake is not made too sweet. It should be
dissolved before being added to the fat and the flour.</p>

<p>For best cakes, and all that are required of a light color,
fine-grained sugar should be used. With coarse-grained sugar there
is danger of producing specks which show on the cakes after baking,
unless they have been made by the method of beating up the eggs and
sugar together with a beater over hot water. This method will
dissolve the grains of sugar.</p>

<p>Always buy the best fruits for cake making, as they are sweetest
and cleanest. Currants and sultana raisins for cakes should not be
too large, but of medium size, sweet and fleshy. Cheap dry sultanas
should not be used. Though there is no need to wash sultanas, yet
if the fruit is inclined <a name="Page_117"></a>to be very dry, it
will be better to do so than to put them in to spoil the appearance
and the flavor of the cake. Currants always should be washed,
cleaned, and dried before using. Orange, lemon, and citron peel
should be of good color and flavor. They should not be added to
cake mixture in chunks, as often is done, but should be in long
shredded pieces. Large pieces of peel are sometimes the cause of a
cake cutting badly. In making fruit cakes add the fruit before the
flour, as this will prevent it falling to the bottom.</p>

<p>If a cake cracks open while baking, the recipe contains too much
flour. There are two kinds of thick crusts which some cakes have.
The first of these is caused by the cake being overbaked in a very
hot oven. Where this is so, the cake, if a very rich one, has a
huge crack in the top caused by the heat of the oven forming a
crust before the inside has finished aerating; then as the interior
air or gas expands, it cracks the crust to escape. This crack
spoils the appearance of the cake, and when cut it generally will
be found to be close and heavy in texture. To guard against this it
is necessary to bake them at a suitable temperature, noting that
the richer the cake the longer the fruit takes to bake.</p>

<p>The second kind of thick crust referred to may only be on top of
the cake, and in this case may be caused by an excess of fat and
sugar being mixed together, or otherwise insufficient flour. In
this case the mixture will not bake, but only forms a kind of syrup
in the oven, and the cake sinks in the center. A cake made under
such conditions would have a thick shiny crust, and be liable to
crumble when touched. The inside of the cake would be heavy, having
more the appearance of pudding than cake.</p>

<p>Successful cake making means constant care. In recipes in which
milk is used as one ingredient, either sweet or buttermilk may be
used but not a mixture of both. Buttermilk makes a light, spongy
cake, and sweet milk makes a cake which cuts like pound cake. <i>In
creaming shortening and sugar, when the shortening is too hard to
blend easily warm the bowl slightly, but do not heat the
shortening, as this will change both the flavor and texture of the
cake.</i> For small cakes have a quick oven, so that they set right
through, and the inside is baked by the time the outside is
browned. For all large cakes have a quick oven at first, to raise
them nicely and prevent the fruit sinking to the bottom. The oven
then should be allowed to become slower to fire the cakes
thoroughly.</p>

<p><a name="Page_118"></a>Cake must not be hurried. Keep the oven
steady though slow, and after putting a large cake into it do not
open the door for at least twenty minutes. During baking, do not
open the door unnecessarily, or in fact do anything to jar the cake
lest the little bubbles formed by the action of the baking powder
burst, causing the gas to escape and the cake to sink. This
produces what is known as a "sad" cake, but refers probably to the
state of mind of the cook. A very light cake put into a quick oven'
rises rapidly round the sides, but leaves a hollow in the
middle.</p>

<p>If a cake is made too light with eggs or powder and an
insufficient quantity of flour is added it will drop in the center.
Another frequent cause is the moving of cakes while in the oven
before the mixture has set properly. The same defect is produced if
the cakes are removed from the oven before being baked
sufficiently. When a cake batter curdles, the texture will not be
so even as if the curdling had not taken place. Sometimes the
mixture will curdle through the eggs being added too quickly, or if
the shortening contains too much water. This forms a syrup with the
sugar, and after a certain quantity of eggs have been added the
batter will slip and slide about, and will not unite with the other
ingredients. Weak, watery eggs are another cause of this happening;
and although this may be checked by adding a little flour at the
right time, yet the cake would be better if it were unnecessary to
add any flour until all the eggs had been beaten in, that is, if
the batter had not curdled. Before turning out a cake allow it to
remain in the tin for a few minutes. It is best to lay it on a wire
cake stand, or lay it on a sieve; but if you do not possess these,
a loosely made basket turned upside down will do. If the cake will
not turn out of the tin easily, rest it on its side, turning it
round in a couple of minutes and it may loosen, if not, pass a
knife round the edge, turn the cake over on a clean cloth, and let
it stand a few minutes.</p>

<p>Do not place cakes in a cold place or at an open window, or the
steam will condense and make them heavy. A rich cake improves in
flavor and becomes softer with keeping (from 2 to 6 weeks,
according to quality) before cutting. Wrap, when cold, first in a
clean towel, then in paper. After a week remove the paper and put
the cake into a tin wrapped in the towel. Small cakes may be baked
in tiny molds or tins, or baked in a flat sheet, and then cut out
into squares, <a name="Page_119"></a>diamonds or rounds. Then they
can be frosted or coated with cream and decorated with cherries or
other crystallized fruits. If a real distinction is desired, they
may be placed in tiny crinkled paper cases, bought by the hundred
at a trifling cost.</p>

<p>Cake tins should be greased with Crisco and dredged with flour,
the superfluous flour shaken out, or they can be fitted with paper
which has been greased with Crisco. When creaming Crisco and sugar,
do not grudge hard work; at this stage of manufacture the tendency
is to give insufficient work, with the result that the lightness of
the cake is impaired.</p>

<div id="vegetarian">
<p>Even those who are by no means decided vegetarians may be glad
to pass over a dinner occasionally without meat. It is perhaps not
too much to say that every housekeeper ought to be able to provide
a meal without the aid of meat. We do not mean by this simply the
cooking of vegetables or the preparations of puddings, but the
presentation of dishes intended to take the place of flesh, such as
soups and broths made without meat, vegetable stews, lentil
fritters and other healthful and nutritious dishes. A vegetarian
menu is not so simple as it sounds. It requires knowledge and
discrimination on the housekeeper's part to serve a solid meal
without flesh or fowl.</p>

<p>Now that meat is so dear it is the favorable moment to try a
vegetable diet for a time. One mistake to be avoided in this
catering is the putting down of too many dishes of a pulpy
character&mdash;food which is soft is excellent with other things,
but alone it is neither satisfying nor very nourishing, at least to
a person of strong digestion. All of them should not be white, for
instance, and the same rule holds good in other things besides
color. A nice dish for this kind of diet is a vegetable curry, in
which all the vegetables are treated like meat and turned out
crisp; all the vegetables, too, must be fresh and young for this
method of serving, so that anything like stringiness is absolutely
impossible.</p>

<p>Crisco is entirely vegetable.</p>

lukewarm water. Put these into a small saucepan with sugar, grated
lemon rind and cold water. Stew slowly until apples are soft. Then
remove prunes, and take out stones. Cut prunes in small pieces and
return them to apples and cool. For pastry, sift flours, sugar,
salt, and spices into basin. Add Crisco and cut it into flour with
knife until finely divided. Then rub together lightly with finger
tips until as fine as breadcrumbs. While rubbing, keep lifting
flour well up in basin so that air may mix with it and Crisco is
not made too soft. Add lemon juice and sufficient water to make
stiff paste. Divide into two equal pieces. Wet a dinner plate with
cold water and leave it wet. Roll out one of the pieces rather
thinly, and line plate with it. Sprinkle cakecrumbs over it, then
spread on mixture. Roll out the other piece of pastry for a cover.
Wet round the edge of the pastry, lay other piece of pastry on, and
press edges well together. Trim round with knife or scissors, and
mark neatly round the edges. Brush over top with a little water or
beaten white of egg. Dredge with sugar, and bake in moderate oven
forty-five minutes. Serve hot or cold. The tart may be covered with

<div id="eggs">
<p>When there is any doubt as to the freshness of eggs, they may be
tested in various ways. Quite fresh eggs will sink in a strong
brine, and as they become stale they remain suspended at different
depths in the brine, until an absolutely stale egg will float.
Successful preservation depends in a great measure upon the
condition of the egg at the time of preserving. Different methods
of preserving all aim at the same thing, namely, at coating the
porous shell with some substance which will prevent the air
entering and setting up decomposition. See page 30.</p>

<p>When used as food, eggs should be cooked at a low
temperature&mdash;about 160&deg; F., or if in the shell at about
180&deg; F. The time varies with the size of the egg, from two and
a half minutes for poaching a medium-sized egg to four and a half
minutes for boiling a large one. If too much cooked, or at too high
a temperature, the white becomes tough, hard, and to many people,
indigestible.</p>

<p>When required for salads, garnishing, etc., the eggs must be
boiled from ten to twenty minutes, and if the yolks are to be
powdered for sprinkling, they must be cooked for a longer time, or
the centers will be somewhat tough and elastic, and useless for the
purpose.</p>

<p>In beating eggs, a little salt added to the whites helps to
bring them to a froth more quickly. When frothed whites are to be
mixed with a heavier or more solid substance, great care must be
taken not to break down the froth. The object of beating being to
mix in air, rough handling afterwards would render the beating
useless; the mixing must therefore be done very carefully. They
should be folded or wrapped up in the other substance, but the
mixing also must be thorough, for any pieces of white separated
from the rest will toughen and taste leathery, besides failing in
the special purpose of giving lightness to the mixture. After
mixing lightly and perfectly all such preparations <a name=
"Page_140"></a>should be cooked at once. The white "speck" always
should be removed from a broken egg, as it is easily distinguished
after cooking, and in anything of a liquid nature, such as
custards, sauces, etc., it would be hard and unpleasant.</p>

<div id="candies">
<p>It is well to have a confectioner's thermometer for candy
making, so that the syrup may be removed from the fire at exactly
the right degree. Such thermometers are made of wood, brass, or
copper, and the degrees on them should mark not less than 350&deg;.
A thermometer always should be gently lowered into the boiling
sugar. When not in use, it should be kept hanging on a nail or
hook. When required for candy making, place thermometer in pitcher
of warm water, so that it may rise gradually, and return it to the
warm water on removing it from the hot candy. This dissolves the
clinging candy and protects the tube from breaking. The wooden
thermometer can be used to stir with, and is very easy to keep
clean.</p>

<p>If there is no thermometer handy it is better to make a list of
the various stages in sugar boiling, and learn how to test the
sugar. First there is the "thread" (216&deg; F. to 218&deg; F.)
This is reached when, on dipping the finger and thumb first into
cold water and then into the syrup, you can draw them apart, and an
unbroken thread is formed, which gradually can be drawn wider apart
on further testing as the degree of boiling is completed.</p>

<p>The next is the "pearl" (220&deg; F.) To see if the syrup has
reached this stage, after the sugar has dissolved let it boil for
eight to ten minutes, then dip a wooden skewer into the syrup to
obtain a drop of it. Dip the finger and thumb into cold water, then
rub the drop of syrup between them; if it feels smooth, the syrup
has reached the desired stage. The next is the "blow" (230&deg; F.)
Dip a spoon into the sugar, shake it, and blow through the holes;
if sparks of light or bubbles be seen, you may be sure of the blow.
This is followed by the "feather" (235&deg; F.) To test this, dip a
spoon into the boiling syrup, and when it may be blown easily from
the spoon in long shreds it has reached the right degree.</p>

<p><a name="Page_144"></a>Next comes the "ball" (240&deg; F. to
250&deg; F.) Dip the finger and thumb first into cold water, and
then into the syrup, the latter then can be rolled into a soft ball
between the finger and thumb. A little longer boiling gives the
hard ball. This in turn is succeeded by the "crack" (290&deg; F. to
300&deg; F.) To test this, drop a little of the syrup into cold
water; if it then breaks off sharp and crisp it has reached the
crack. The final stage is the "caramel" (350&deg; F.) which comes
very quickly after the crack, the syrup becoming first a pale
yellow, and then a rich golden brown, and finally black or burnt.
When it first reaches this stage the pan should be removed from the
fire, a little lemon juice or water added, and then the whole
reboiled to the proper stage or shade. To prevent granulation, it
often is advisable to add a pinch of cream of tartar, to the pound
of sugar.</p>

in saucepan, add meat and fry lightly for several minutes, add
onion, finely chopped, stir over fire for about 5 minutes, season
with salt and pepper to taste and add potatoes. Pour off
superfluous fat, mix carefully and moisten with cream and 1
tablespoon rich white stock, season with a sufficiency of paprika
pepper to give sauce a pink tint, and cook gently for 20 minutes.
It is best to cook the Goulash at latter stage in a fireproof
earthenware stewpan, in which it should be sent to table. Great
care must be taken so as not to break potatoes while cooking. Serve

with a little onion, carrot, celery, and herbs, and strained for
use. Bring stock to boiling point, sprinkle in sago, or tapioca,
and stir and cook until it becomes transparent; then let soup cool
slightly. Mix yolks of eggs and the cream together, then the melted
Crisco, and add to soup and stir till it thickens; it should have
the consistency of single cream. When a thicker soup is desired,
mix teaspoon flour or cornstarch with a little milk, and add it to
soup at same time as sago or tapioca. Season to taste, and

off with one stroke of the knife, just where they join the body.
With another clean cut divide each lengthwise into 2 equal parts,
shell and all. Take out coral, the one long intestine and stomach.
Crack claws with a hammer. Put within a Criscoed broiler, split
side downward, and broil over fire. As soon as juice begins to run
freely withdraw long enough to baste liberally with melted Crisco,
and return to fire, turning often to keep in juices. Cook about 10
minutes on split or flesh side, and 8 upon other. Have ready sauce
made by rubbing 2 tablespoons Crisco to cream with lemon juice and
finely-minced parsley, adding little red pepper, and baste lobsters
with this while hissing hot. Serve half lobster to each guest.</p>

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
